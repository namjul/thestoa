Forrest Landry holds a unique polymathic background as a master woodworker, software architect, engineer, author, philosopher, mystic, researcher, and many other roles and titles. Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format. Bring your questions, interests, hopes, and dreams, and perhaps together we can deepen curiosities, expand understandings, and celebrate the gift of life through community and conversation at the Stoa.
