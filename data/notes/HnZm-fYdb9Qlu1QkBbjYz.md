March 16th, 2021

This session is a part of the "Let Us Maybe Make the Meta-Crisis Our Superordinate Goal Symposium"

Derrick Jensen returns to The Stoa, along with Lierre Keith and Max Wilber, the co-authors of his new book: Bright Green Lies: How the Environmental Movement Lost Its Way and What We Can Do About It (Politics of the Living)

"Bright Green Lies exposes the hypocrisy and bankruptcy of leading environmental groups and their most prominent cheerleaders. The best-known environmentalists are not in the business of speaking truth, or even holding up rational solutions to blunt the impending ecocide, but instead indulge in a mendacious and self-serving delusion that provides comfort at the expense of reality. They fail to state the obvious: We cannot continue to wallow in hedonistic consumption and industrial expansion and survive as a species. The environmental debate, Derrick Jensen and his coauthors argue, has been distorted by hubris and the childish desire by those in industrialized nations to sustain the unsustainable.‚Äù - Chris Hedges

This event caps our meta-crisis symposium and it also serves as a book launch party.
