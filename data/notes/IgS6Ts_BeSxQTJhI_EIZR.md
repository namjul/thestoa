In this session hosts Jason Snyder and Ashley Colby welcome internationally renowned ecological activist Dr. Vandana Shiva. In this session Jason and Ashley pass off the hosting duties to former guest Chis Smaje, author of A Small Farm Future. Chris Smaje and Dr. Vandana Shiva have a similar vision for the future: local economies, small scale and diverse agriculture, and an increase in self-provisioning. With Chris focused on Europe, Vandana's activism in India and Africa, Jason's homestead in the United States and Ashley's small farm in Uruguay, we have five continents represented in this discussion.  In this session we hope to put forward a doomer optimist vision for an international small farm future collaboration. How can we see our futures as interdependent? How can we fight against corporate and tech interests that seem to want to move peasants from their land?
