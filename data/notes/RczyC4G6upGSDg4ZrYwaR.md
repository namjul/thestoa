Ran Lahav is a philosophical practitioner and the creator of Deep Philosophy (formerly known as philosophical companionships). Ran will visit The Stoa to discuss Deep Philosophy and how to philosophize from our inner depth.

“This book provides a comprehensive overview of the principles and methods of Deep Philosophy, practiced by the international Deep Philosophy Group. Deep Philosophy means doing philosophy from our inner depth. By contemplating on fundamental aspects of life, we seek to relate to the foundation of human reality. By doing so from our inner depth, we seek to give voice to our deepest personal sensitivities and yearnings.”
