<p>Join us for a conversation between two women artists who support emerging leaders and teams in design and the creative industries. Greg Thomas, the curator and moderator of this chat, is bringing together his Integral friend Lisa and his junior high chum Maria to: define design thinking and leadership based on such a mindset; the lessons they've learned in the design industry and academic settings (Marie Guidice as a founder and organizational designer, and Lisa Norton as a transformative learning context designer working in several academic organizations); and how being a woman does or does not factor in their current career focus.</p>
<p>Maria, the co-author of Rise of the DEO: Leadership By Design, is the founder of the experience design firm Hot Studio, which was bought by Facebook in 2013. After leading global design teams at Facebook and Autodesk, she now coaches leaders and teams to achieve their creative potential.</p>
<p>Lisa is a professor of Design Leadership in Parsons School of Design Strategies at the New School. She is prototyping Uncertainty Lab, a group process for cultivating states of negative capability, and Design Being, a pattern language for designers and cultural influencers.</p>
