Taylor Barratt from Authentic Relating Toronto (www.circling.ca) visits The Stoa to discuss the intersubjective practice of Circling. A generally accepted history of the scene will be presented, along with how the scene and practice have evolved, and its potential role in the meta-crisis, meaning crisis, and culture wars.
