Lubomir Arsov, the creator of In-Shadow, returns to The Stoa to explore how the emerging technocratic AI grid feeds off of our collective shadow, amplifies its contents, and snuffs out our potential for participating in organic human culture.

Shadowplay is hosted by Arran Rogerson and Alyssa Polizzi of the Golden Shadow more info: https://www.goldenshadow.org
