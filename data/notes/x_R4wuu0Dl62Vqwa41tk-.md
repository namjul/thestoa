***This is a preview of the "Rap Unbattles" that is occurring at The Stoa on Mondays in October at 9 PM ET. ***

Rap (Un)battles is a space to collectively practice freestyle rap and spoken word as a way of engaging in good-faith dialectic, sharpen our thinking, and build communitas.

There are 4 basic guidelines:

1) End your flow by asking a question or making an argument
start your flow by addressing the last (or other preceding flow),
2) Allow nonlinearity and chaos, then bring it back to the center
practice rule omega,
3) Risk not speaking elegantly in favor of experimentation,
4) Listen deeply to others and give them the benefit of the doubt.
