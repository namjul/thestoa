Allison Duettman, president of Foresight Institute (https://foresight.org), visits The Stoa to discuss the importance of existential hope.

“Just as we tend to talk about the existential risk rather than existential catastrophe, we want to be able to refer to the chance of an existential eucatastrophe; upside risk on a large scale. We could call such a chance an existential hope.” From Existential Risk and Existential Hope: Definitions by Owen Cotton-Barratt & Toby Ord, https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Existential-risk-and-existential-hope.pdf
