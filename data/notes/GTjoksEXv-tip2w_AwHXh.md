Brandon Norgaard visits The Stoa to present his new article: Comparing Approaches to Addressing the Meta-Crisis

“This is often known as the meta-crisis and also sometimes as the poly-crisis. The central idea is that our biosphere is facing an ecological emergency and that we have serious failings in other areas of public life that are preventing us from adequately addressing this emergency. Most notably, our political, socio-cultural, economic, and educational systems are all showing very serious failures, and thus we can consider each of these to be a distinct crisis in its own right. These crises are exacerbated by a breakdown in public sensemaking and by distortions within the information ecology. At the core is the so-called meaning crisis, which leads many people to confusion and alienation and an inability to find sufficient intelligibility and purpose within their lives.”
