We will discuss the art of human encounter as discovered in the practice of steam. How do heat and steam allow us to navigate our boundaries and our authentic experience? How can this experience be guided towards the human encounter? Steam is arguably the oldest tradition to systematically approach communal bonds healing. We will make a journey between past and present, between traditional shamanism and contemporary self-discovery and community building.
