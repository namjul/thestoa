<p>What is the Liminal Space Agency? Who do we think we are, and what have we been up to?</p>
<p>Who is Jean Robertson? What are her credentials? How does it come about that she’s marking her 79th birthday live on this Stoa session today? What’s the story?</p>
<p>Who are you to us and us to you, that you would enter into some kind of conversational space with us? What work might we have to do together?</p>
<p>Jean: I’m someone who remembers saying to a friend some time in the 1990’s ( my late 50’s, remember) “I want the rest of my life to be a series of passionate conversations”. And that wish has led to my finding myself on my 79th living and working with a group of people age range 20’s to 50’s in a constant stream of conversation.</p>
<p>I’ve never liked the idea of being an ‘elder’ yet I do resonate withliving into the question of what is it to become good ancestors for the future of humaning on this planet.</p>
<p>Liminal Space Agency’ is a learnng community with a shared focus on our taking 100% co-response-ability for the human conversation, and finding out what that means. It acts as a research and development vehicle/meta-monastery for stewarding what we’ve been calling the ‘sacred human conversation’.</p>
<p>Teresa: “And I’m thinking that it’s your life’s work that has led to the maps that we’ve been using to be able to steward this and take co-response-ability in the way that we are”.</p>
<p>Jean: it seems like we had better get on with it, if I am 79 and we sense that we’re just moving into a fertile phase.</p>
<p>Our current directions of learning:
Doing differences differently; living life and our lives as process; everyone’s subjective experience matters; making everything talk-about-able same-sidedly.</p>
