Philosopher Ole Bjerg visits The Stoa to discuss his book: The Meaning of Being a Man.

“What does it mean to be a man? While this is a key question for at least half the population of the world, Ole Bjerg argues that it has been largely forgotten by philosophy. In his groundbreaking new book, he mobilizes ideas from Martin Heidegger and Hannah Arendt to coin the notion of Being-Man as an alternative to the conventional talk about gender and identity.”
