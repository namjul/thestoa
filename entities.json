From Jack ...\n\n\"The example that I use to explain ontological flooding a lot of the time is with spirit mediumship, where you have all of these competing explanations, which think that they’ve sorted it all out. Like I said before, social protest theories say that spirit mediumship is all about social protest. Then you’ve got biological, medical theories that say that spirit mediumship is just a biological aberration, as some kind of an illness or a disease. There are psychodynamic theories, all sorts of different theories, but at the end of the day, none of them is a completely satisfying explanation in themselves.\n\nActually, when you start to piece them together, we see that we’re dealing with something that is way more complex than any of those individual explanatory frameworks has been able to accommodate. So, ontological flooding is really saying...we need to take into account all of these various perspectives at the same time, to get the best or the nearest to reality perspective that we can get.”\n\nWebsite: https://jack-hunter.webstarts.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Chris is well known for his book A Small Farm Future. In it, he argues that our best hope for an optimistic future will be centered around local economies, self-provisioning, and agricultural diversity. In this session, we hope to interrogate Chris on the explicit pathways he might see for us to achieve a small farm future. Drawing on Chris’ encyclopedic historical knowledge of past agricultural societies, we’d like to ask him to talk through some historical precedents for our time period.\n\nOne example might be the Middle Ages, which often gets a bad rap, but recently Chris tweeted “I’d suggest almost the opposite - dark ages are often when ruling elites stop ruling & forget how to keep writing about their own brilliance for posterity. Then ordinary people can come out a play for a bit. Dark age for some, but not for others…” We hope to debate the question of a sustainable diet and best strategies for achieving agricultural diversity in a world where environmental policy makers increasingly call for a global diet.  Finally, in advance of our next session with Dr. Vandana Shiva, we will ask Chris to envision what international cooperation around a small farm future might look like, and how we can help.\n\nMore from Chris: https://smallfarmfuture.org.uk/\nMore sessions from Doomer Optimism: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoZ5e3aD_LuRA8KAhmYqselHOWt9nT0Xj\nNext session of Doomer Optimism: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwlfuCrqDIuHN06VPlT6PLmiylHbBrPtRPl\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Those notes met the realities of covid 19, the lockdowns and upheavals, and turned into something of a plague document.

There is a climate emergency that requires urgent action, but the precise nature, cost, location and responsibility of that action is moot. There is a broader crisis of civilisational purpose that appears to necessitate political and economic transformation, and there are deeper socio-emotional, educational, epistemic and spiritual features of our predicament that manifest as many flavours of meta-crisis: the lack of a meaningful global ‘We’, widespread learning needs, self-subverting political logics and disenchanted worldviews. These different features of our world are obscured by their entanglement with each other. It is difficult to orient ourselves towards meaningful action that is commensurate with our understanding because we are generally unclear about the relationship between different kinds of challenge and what they mean for us. That’s what this essay is about. The world is in a pickle, and, daunting though it is, we need to learn how to taste it. Tasting the pickle well requires, in the spirit of Vivekananda, finding joy and releasing energy through the right kinds of discrimination.”\n\nSource: https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport stealing the culture: patreon.com/the_stoa\nReceive coaching with resonance: https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches","created":1615849200000,"persons":["ece67e3ef32b1b90da1c7563a90a5f1f"],"tags":["b6dc0555b51a63f2f9df1e8b8d8f561d","114b76687382c79ece756401692008ca","352e29b713b046dd6eb6f0093398a61d","b6755d218d5f4e1cef9cce9cc39aeda9","9dc772d82afb9a5374668bd51a50cc8c"],"slug":"tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis","part":null},"9745f2872bf3c6a75fe9abdd10692c25":{"id":"Co-qhwL2BDlGsg4LumSbz","hash":"9745f2872bf3c6a75fe9abdd10692c25","youtubeId":"0MGQgQZHx1Q","rawTitle":"Resolving the Meta-Crisis With Emergent Movements and Post-Consumerist Praxis w/ Jacob Lund Fisker","title":"Resolving the Meta-Crisis With Emergent Movements and Post-Consumerist Praxis","body":"September 2nd, 2021\n\nEven twenty years into the early 21st century we remain unable to agree on how to solve the multiple big and complex problems facing the world, still thinking reality is just a matter of opinion until it hits too close and personal.

This can be tricky to see but immensely relieving once recognized. It dissolves a pattern that often causes burnout in folk who are trying to do as much good as they can — while also revealing why so many efforts to do good create the opposite effect. In this three-part series, ex-savior-aholic Michael Smith will offer a framework for both understanding and directly experiencing the underlying truths here. The aim is to offer relief, pop some beliefs that serve egos instead of compassion, and embody kindness in a way that matters. The first session will be an introduction and overview with some discussion and hopefully a little experimental practice, and the following two sessions will focus on practice and embodiment with content TBD based on what happens in each session.

In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows. The localists talk about homesteading and small farms, the bioregionalists talk about healing ecological trauma and living within the limits of the earth, the decentralization movement talks about currency protocols and smart contracts, and the metamodernists talk about stage theory while drinking lattes from their urban condos. In this session we will discuss what these movements have in common, and how they can put aside their differences, synthesize their perspectives while not always liking each other, and unite to save the planet while solving our precious meaning crisis too. \n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format. Bring your questions, interests, hopes, and dreams, and perhaps together we can deepen curiosities, expand understandings, and celebrate the gift of life through community and conversation at the Stoa.

She will describe the 5 steps of trigger work and then guide participants in some exercises from the book—exercises that teach you how to catch and calm trigger reactions so you can get back to being present and resourceful. Doing these exercises will help you heal your fear of emotional discomfort and allow you to handle situations you used to avoid.\n\n Here is an excerpt from the book: “Your trigger reactions can be the doorway to understanding and embodying a much bigger life process that I like to call whole-making. As I see it, life itself is about whole-making —integrating the various parts of a system into increasingly interrelated wholes. Our trigger reactions help us see aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of. As we explore these reactions, we discover parts of ourselves that have been denied, abandoned, or repressed. This is the realm of the human unconscious that psychologists call our shadow. As we enter through this portal, we encounter forgotten hurts and disappointments, unmet childhood needs, protective personality habits that we adopted to keep us safe, beliefs that help us make sense of things we don’t understand, and ideas about ourselves and others that feed the insecure ego’s need to be knowledgeable, good, or right.

The latter two have long since failed and passed out of the pages of history, and the first no longer operates as an ideology, but rather as something taken for granted. The world today finds itself on the brink of a post-political reality — one in which the values of liberalism are so deeply embedded that the average person is not aware that there is an ideology at work around him.\n\nAs a result, liberalism is threatening to monopolise political discourse and drown the world in a universal sameness, destroying everything that makes the various cultures and peoples unique. According to Alexander Dugin, what is needed to break through this morass is a fourth ideology — one that will sift through the debris of the first three to look for elements that might be useful, but that remains innovative and unique in itself.\"\n\nDugin's website here: http://www.4pt.su/en\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Although metta is often taught in formulaic and repetitive (read: boring) ways, metta is most effective and enjoyable when you make it your own, exploring and playing with the kinds of images and phrases that generate the most joy, happiness, and love in your body-mind complex. In this three-part series, Tasshin will introduce you to loving kindness practice and help you to discover your own style of metta practice that resonates with you - your own form of \"weird metta.\" This series will culminate in the third and final session, a metta-focused dance party, so you can embody and enjoy your newfound, weird and wonderful loving-kindness skills with others.\n\nTo sign-up for part 2: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIpc--oqTIjHNSgzIrepz-2OgO13G2TJaEM\n\nThis recording is licensed with a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In this series, each week Dave will look at \"naturalising sense-making\" from different scientific perspectives to develop an overall theory. Dave defines sense-making as \"How do we make sense of the world so we can act in it”. Peter Jones of OCAD University in Toronto defined five schools of sensemaking in a 2015 article in Epic (see below). Snowden will explore aspects of this framing in terms of how do we gain a sufficiency of understanding to take action and will more specifically look at:\n\n-Issues relating to epistemic justice in collective sensemaking\n-The abductive turn in ethnographic research; looking for weak signals in dispositional systems\n-Beyond crude manipulation of much behaviour economics to an elaborated vector theory of change\n-Can we reverse Ashby’s Law?

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format.

The authors propose new ways to fight back and discuss how the future of noopolitik might depend on what happens to the global commons—i.e., the parts of the Earth and space that fall outside national jurisdictions and to which all nations are supposed to have access.\"\n\nSupport The Stoa @ https://www.patreon.com/the_stoa\nJoin The Stoa mailing list @ https://thestoa.substack.com","created":1598392800000,"persons":["f99902421141428df26a105feb401fa9","572dd00990885672b7f8d474dbb69b5f"],"tags":["b3ec30aa609ec886990dcb92aece8a68","dfba89a600b608b2b724efe1f06f599a"],"slug":"whose-story-wins","part":null},"9b5bf5ec4759ffd8a4aa4f4bbe56fc26":{"id":"A_US9F8r1VShT8mO1RnjT","hash":"9b5bf5ec4759ffd8a4aa4f4bbe56fc26","youtubeId":"mL-1zRqAPW0","rawTitle":"Squad Wealth w/ Toby Shorin, Laura Lotti, and Sam Hart","title":"Squad Wealth","body":"February 18th, 2021\n\nThe fine folks from Other Internet visit The Stoa! \n\n\"SQUADS HAVE EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS as vital forms of social and economic organization. Thanks to group chats and a wave of private online social platforms, squads are reemerging today as a potent cultural force that rejects a strictly individualist market philosophy. Squads play a key role not only in internet community dynamics but in emerging economic networks. Hawala, chit funds, chamas and other forms of P2P savings or credit associations are notable precursors to the kinds of financial relationships we anticipate decentralized cryptocurrency protocols will soon enable. These proto-squads are an example of Coaseian logic at play—that is, strong internal coordination decreases transaction costs, enabling greater productive capacities and financial opportunities as a group.\n\nThe informal nature of these peer-to-peer institutions, often composed of neighbors and friends, reveals the central role that trust plays in squad logic. Whether housemates or friends sharing a Discord group, squads allow social currency and financial capital to inter-convert, creating opportunities and group resiliency that would have been impossible to achieve alone.\"\n\nMore info: https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In the pictures, it is so clear what they were countering: The Man, of course, who, with his white collar, white skin, and short hair, singlehandedly symbolized dominant cultural norms. In the age of social media, personal expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear, as if dressing middle-class, white, and preppy still aligned with the rules of power today.\n\nIn an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes all who live within the Google/Apple/Facebook/ Amazon digital ecosystem (aka GAFA stack). With digital platforms transforming legacy countercultural activity into profitable, high-engagement content, being countercultural no longer means being counter-hegemonic. What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?\"\n\nMore from Caroline: https://carolinebusta.github.io\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Hellinger discovered a host of principles and orders which occur in the network of relationships and bonds through many generations. These orders and principles prove themselves through the practical work.

We will review the most cynically effective protocols to work through and settle the grieving process. From the perspective of Tibetan Bon and Buddhist meditation practices, the practitioner prepares for dying by practicing consciousness-transferences. While dying there are three after-death states—the state of the actual dying practice, the state of the sound and light show of the dharmahatu, and the state determining rebirth. The advanced practitioner learns to carry meditation practice into these three after-death states, so as to use the dying process as an opportunity to complete Buddhahood. The most advanced practitioner uses the dying process to dissolve the residual substantiality of the physical body upon dying, so as to achieve great consciousness-transference or rainbow body. Through these practices the meditator gains voluntary control over the dying process and can emanate in any form and any place according to intention.\n\nSupport The Stoa @ patreon.ca/the_stoa","created":1598738400000,"persons":["91781268cfb9e3cc07473494765164e5"],"tags":["a99dc62d017d04cf67266593f9c3761e","bf495fc048d8d44b7f32536df5cf3930"],"slug":"dying-east-and-west","part":null},"b5e6b4178504bd173094f555568fe94a":{"id":"cABMHUtJrKMk_tl2qzlk6","hash":"b5e6b4178504bd173094f555568fe94a","youtubeId":"YWQTW14sGis","rawTitle":"The Dark Stoa: Game A - Robotic Nationalism w/ Patrick Ryan","title":"The Dark Stoa","desc":" Game A - Robotic Nationalism","body":"May 29th, 2020\n\nThe Dark Stoa is where the Stoic art of negative visualization is taken to the darkest corner of our collective mind.

Instead, regeneration is about activating the capability and will to shift unhealthy ingrained patterns so that we can step into our innate potential as stewards of life. Regeneration involves relationality and the ability to cultivate it towards higher orders of complexity. We are co-evolutionary participants with this world and regeneration is about bringing that into awareness and practice again - caring for and taking responsibility for our commons. Soul Shivers is a multimedia dialogue series dedicated to weaving disparate voices of women from around the world in service of collective regeneration.

With humanity's future on this planet seeming more insecure by the day, in the twenty-first century, existential risk has become the object of a growing field of serious scientific inquiry.

Each effector pattern has three parts: (1) a breathing pattern, (2) facial expression, and (3) postural attitude. All three parts work together to create one effector pattern, or biological code, that directly stimulates nerves, cells and organs. The resulting pattern works like a key that opens the door for one particular basic emotion to express throughout the entire body.\n\nThe discovery of these patterns helped to create a physical method for evoking and regulating emotion. The patterns are based on scientific findings, independent of gender or social heritage influences, and result in the expression of basic universal emotions and modes of expression.\"\n\nhttps://emotionalbody.co\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692046119\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In the internet era, no-one escapes the global revolution of learning, connecting and mobilising and its entangled consequences.\n\nThis reality demands a political response. But our current politics - led by divisive parties and their exhausted ideologies - are clearly broken and dysfunctional. Only 2% of the UK electorate think it’s worth the time or money to join a political party.\n\nHow do we put the full spectrum of a consciously awakening humanity at the heart of society, economy and politics? As social bonds fray and the planet burns, a politics of \"waking up\" is more urgently required than ever.\n\nInformed by decades of public advocacy, transformative work with both local and global communities, as well as her lifelong commitment to self-development, The Politics of Waking Up lays out Adnan’s practical, beautiful and urgent ways to redesign politics for an era of people power.\n\nDrawing on the last five years of political entrepreneurship as co-initiator of The Alternative UK, Adnan shares a compelling vision of a “fractal” politics with an emphasis on new patterns of behaviour and viable prototypes of social progress that can be copied and replicated everywhere.\n\nThe Politics of Waking Up presents a coherent, radical and profoundly feminine alternative to our current socio-political turbulence. One that is there for the taking.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Technocapitalism cephalises - it becomes a sentient and autonomous entity. It gains a will of its own, continually recycling human desire for its own survival and replication. And it is only accelerating. Ontological design is a way of facing up to this dire state of affairs. It is the idea that we can acknowledge our circumstances and make the best of them - perhaps going so far as designing our desires, our beliefs and our ontologies, the very vectors technocapitalism colonises us through.\n\nIn this session, Daniel Fraga and Owen Cox from Technosocial Podcast are joined by an illustrious panel composed by transhumanist philosopher queen Rachel Haywire, rabble-rousing rogue sensemaker Andrew Sweeny from Parallax Magazine and the internet's foremost memeticist, Chris Gabriel from Meme Analysis.\n\nWe will explore questions such as: what do spiritual and magical traditions have to teach us, who live in this weirdest of ages? What kind of subcultures can emerge in this panorama? How do we understand and engage with the ghosts, poltergeists and egregores of the world-wide web? In crafts like carpentry, it is said that there is a will, a wisdom inherent in the material itself - that the possibility for the finished product already exists, latent, in the wood. What is then latent in the prima materia of human attention? What is Art, in this context? And what kind of darkness must we face in order to stare it dead in the eye?\n\nJoin us for a trip to the underworld - if you can handle it.\n\n***\n\nRead more about ontological design here: https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-manifesto-of-ontological-design-7fdb19169107\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport stealing the culture: patreon.com/the_stoa\nReceive coaching with resonance: https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches","created":1612220400000,"persons":["eb42e79bd50894df3e7e3141e7c6d90c","5106ee675d8167d988c25ecab18cc93b","2d890d95b836e3a771a79b35df6d3e1c"],"tags":["fa1e28835c072460001a59e4bbb4be04","b2f12288b501da03450945cfccf2ca12"],"slug":"ontological-design-how-art-frames-being","part":null,"series":["fa1e28835c072460001a59e4bbb4be04"]},"90c2646dd6a920640158fecb5c9993a2":{"id":"Ron6orpTGiZwSQ3oBKlMb","hash":"90c2646dd6a920640158fecb5c9993a2","youtubeId":"BL9X4UKeuVo","rawTitle":"The Elusive I w/ John Vervaeke, Gregg Henriques, and Christopher Mastropietro","title":"The Elusive I","body":"June 24th, 2021\n\nJohn, Gregg, and Chris return to The Stoa to conclude their dialogos series with a Q&A.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Often, when a newcomer joins an institution like the Willow Monastic Academy, this presents a significant change to their regular way of life, and is an unexpected challenge to how they show up in the training.\n\nWe may expect it to be difficult to sit on the cushion and meditate for two hours a day, but it turns out the difficult thing is actually to be on time for activities, to wash our dishes well, and to exercise every day. The ways in which we habitually fall out of the structure are mirrors to our ingrained habit-patterns, and can be seeds for significant self-exploration.\n\nIn this talk, Sei will talk about why a shared structure can be an incredibly beneficial tool for human maturation, how this shows up at Willow, and how we may be able to bring this into our lives even without becoming full-time monastics\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

One which will be solved by talented curators, technomancers, and eventually by the autonomous superorganisms we're breeding in the internet.\n\nThe future is invading us at the speed of broadband, and we will need to understand how to cult(ivate) our own memetic fields to survive.

This can be tricky to see but immensely relieving once recognized. It dissolves a pattern that often causes burnout in folk who are trying to do as much good as they can — while also revealing why so many efforts to do good create the opposite effect. In this three-part series, ex-savior-aholic Michael Smith will offer a framework for both understanding and directly experiencing the underlying truths here. The aim is to offer relief, pop some beliefs that serve egos instead of compassion, and embody kindness in a way that matters. The first session will be an introduction and overview with some discussion and hopefully a little experimental practice, and the following two sessions will focus on practice and embodiment with content TBD based on what happens in each session.

From Plato onwards, love both permits access to knowledge and presents a distraction to it. This week will examine the multiple types of Greek love - philia, eros, pragma, storge, philautia, ludus, agape, xenia - and suggest that our age has become unduly dominated by one particular idea of love - a combination of eros and possessiveness, love as a commodity. Against this, the love of the philosophers, past and present - love of the city, love that opens people up to the cosmos, will be presented as a critique of our narrow image. \n\nMore from Nina: https://ninapower.net\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We are guided to introspect on our thinking and behaviour, to make connections between our past and our present circumstances, and to learn how to let go of the past and make positive changes.\n\nHowever, because the effects of trauma and conditioning are actually held physically - in the body - they may also be addressed in that environment.\n\nWorking with the body in this manner also removes the biases that can come from living in an environment where there is much subtle and non-subtle influencing about how we &quot;should be.&quot; Understanding that we are blocked, we can simply work to remove the blocks, knowing that whatever remains will be a more pure version of our authentic self.\n\nIn Bioenergetics, we put our body into specific postures and then endeavour to maintain the posture, whilst breathing deeply through the mouth and remaining intimately in touch with the felt sense of the body. At some point, holding patterns from the muscle system begin to release.\n\nThe aim of Bioenergetics is to leave you feeling more grounded and more open, better able to hold safe boundaries and simultaneously more okay with being vulnerable.\n\nSession Timetable:\n-Introduction to Bioenergetics and the session - 15 mins\n-Guided Bioenergetics session - 30 mins\n-Q&A - 30 mins\n\nPlease wear loose clothing and take responsibility to not be intoxicated.\n\nSome of the exercises will require a small amount of sound, perhaps grunting or similar.

The research shows that skepticism of consensus building is misplaced; that it works in situations of high uncertainty and low trust, to build collective sensemaking and solidarity. The guided process begins by embracing the fear and chaos surrounding a given problem, a clear call to action, going through many steps and conceptual layers, and ends with wiser informed coordinated action and connectedness. Contrary to groupthink, consensus actually immunizes against herd mentality and promotes the integration of diverse views. From the group practices and building blocks that the Stoa stewards, to the exogenous critiques that problematize and strengthen the discourse, we are finally primed to build and experiment with a true collective intelligence for a common paradigm shift.

Being less egotistical is one way of addressing this tension, but I'll explore a more taboo, route. We can recognise that ideals of equality offer an amazingly effective moral ‘rule of thumb’, but have, unhealthily, become enshrined as the truth, taboo to even question. They have also become a very unsatisfactory replacement for compassion and love, which in more ‘spiritual’ times were the center of moral life, with consequences that may be truly disastrous when considered alongside issues such as climate chaos.\"\n\nhttps://lifeitself.us\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows.\n\nIn this session Ashley and Jason will tell the story of the birth of Doomer Optimism on Twitter, and ask the participants of the session to co-create the definition and examples of what Doomer Optimism might come to represent. The goal of this session is to set the stage, define terms and expectations, and begin the formation of a big tent community.\n\nThis session will be the first part of a Doomer Optimist Series hosted by Ashley and Jason. The series will start by interviewing some public intellectuals, asking them to bring their perspective to bear on Doomer Optimism. The series will then hold several panels of doomer optimists, making some space to ask questions, solve problems, and make plans. We don't know what we will find or create with the Doomer Optimist series, but the only way out is through. Join us!\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The second is that philosophy, at least some of the time, should be pursued in public. In this series, Adam Robbert will bring TSV to The Stoa and explore the nature of philosophical practice inside and outside of the academy, the peril and promise of doing philosophy in the wild, and the relation between askēsis and the deliverances of philosophy.

The aim is to offer relief, pop some beliefs that serve egos instead of compassion, and embody kindness in a way that matters.

We are human primates. We are social in our very bones. Isolation is punishment. Silence is dull.\n\nHere is another definition: meditation is the bringing of attention to experience, and training in meditation is training in attention. By this definition, neither isolation nor silence are required; we can train together, and that is good, because together is what we were born for.\nSocial meditation brings the benefits of traditional silent meditation while simultaneously cultivating intimacy and strengthening bonds between humans. Social meditation is engaging in a way that only social activities can be.

The core idea is that one of these two subagents constructs a model of the \"world.\" The agent that constructs the world model is the conscious agent whose \"experiences\" represent the attention mechanism implemented by that agent. This model proposes a materialistic explanation of the distinction between Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness and proposes a solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The model also explains normal human consciousness, flow state, and enlightened \"self-less\" states of consciousness.\n\nIn Part 2 (of 2), on January 16th, Frank \"Explains Spirituality\" using a materialistic three-agent model of the brain; this model builds on the two-agent model of Part 1 presented on Jan 9th. If you didn't see that talk, please watch it on The Stoa YouTube channel or watch the 26-minute video on www.SpiritualityExplained.com. The core idea is that modern humans have developed a potent \"Thinker\" agent (the third agent of the three-agent model), which has enabled modern human civilization's attainments. Unfortunately, the Thinker often causes suffering for modern humans, and spirituality was developed to ameliorate that suffering.\n\nThe development of the more powerful Thinker agent in modern humans can clarify the distinctions between animal consciousness, normal human consciousness, flow state, and the various enlightened states of consciousness. This model also shows that common spiritual practices can result in decreased suffering. Some forms of spiritual practices allow the attainment of \"Enlightenment,\" which can eliminate the suffering caused by the Thinker. \n\nwww.SpiritualityExplained.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

For us, regeneration is not just a set of alternative solutions - nor is it just about nature. Instead, regeneration is about activating the capability and will to shift unhealthy ingrained patterns so that we can step into our innate potential as stewards of life. Regeneration involves relationality and the ability to cultivate it towards higher orders of complexity. We are co-evolutionary participants with this world and regeneration is about bringing that into awareness and practice again - caring for and taking responsibility for our commons. Soul Shivers is a multimedia dialogue series dedicated to weaving disparate voices of women from around the world in service of collective regeneration. Twice a year, we gather four women around four themes and collectively support the dialogues with multimedia expressions seen in art, poetry, letters, and more. The themes we will explore are (1) ancestry (2) trauma (3) connection to place and (4) peace. \" - Freya and Luea\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Designed as a field handbook, it aims at helping us observe, navigate, and orientate into the increasingly artificial fabric of the world. Plastiglomerates, surveillance robot dogs, fordite, artificial grass, antenna trees, Sars-Covid-2, decapitated mountains, drone-fighting eagles, standardised bananas… each of these specimens are symptomatic of the rapidly transforming “post-natural” era we live in. Often without us even noticing them, these creatures exponentially spread and co-exist with us.\n\nA Bestiary of the Anthropocene seeks to capture this precise moment when the biosphere and technosphere merge and mesh into one new hybrid body. What happens when technologies and their unintended consequences become so ubiquitous that it is difficult to define what is “natural” or not? What does it mean to live in a hybrid environment made of organic and synthetic matter? What new specimens are currently populating our planet at the beginning of the 21st century?\"\n\nSource: http://bestiaryanthropocene.com\n\nhttps://www.nicolasnova.net\nhttps://disnovation.org\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport The Stoa: patreon.com/the_stoa\nReceive coaching with resonance: https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches","created":1623621600000,"persons":["f6e8d841c125e36eb07aaef20ed8fc99","776835c4a11dc3114f770bf3e0cb930a","b18dcd97dcaa35233ce7b766fd89b692"],"tags":["1ddb7a5531483027d772134ff2df3d84","b3979e519b4441d9dc1bc21f43bed094"],"slug":"a-bestiary-of-the-anthropocene","part":null},"0c07ab39f7647ed5e1200fc14e477d61":{"id":"8QkR66rG-lokWNSIABeDf","hash":"0c07ab39f7647ed5e1200fc14e477d61","youtubeId":"U8pSEFcIac4","rawTitle":"The Contemplative's Socrates w/ David Collins and Adam Robbert","title":"The Contemplative's Socrates","body":"David Collins visits The Stoa to discuss his latest The Side View article, \"The Contemplative's Socrates.\" In this discussion, Dave will highlight Socrates' daemonic and spiritual side, offering the perspective that the origins of Western philosophy were rooted as much in contemplative practice as in rational argument.\n\nRead the full article here: https://thesideview.co/journal/the-contemplatives-socrates\nCheck out Adam's The Side View @ https://thesideview.co\n\nSupport The Stoa @ www.patreon.com/the_stoa","created":1598302352000,"persons":["29419a7445089c67414f7a25650c6939","eb7305a03f7772b6195dc8054818807b"],"tags":["3776d38b1ca4fa468fff9f8879ec7d36","ceab0df15872e1477dc71ef84b29cb03"],"slug":"the-contemplative's-socrates","part":null},"cc3497a470c51f41d81fa9cd1a975fb4":{"id":"en1bJxJkvb5l9DXhRVTW0","hash":"cc3497a470c51f41d81fa9cd1a975fb4","youtubeId":"BVIpSanPSw0","rawTitle":"God Bless the Broken Bones w/ William Ferraiolo","title":"God Bless the Broken Bones","body":"Stoic author William Ferraiolo, visits The Stoa to discuss his new book: God Bless the Broken Bones: Meditations Over One Botched, Bungled, and Beautiful Year.

It was hard enough to flourish in the pre-internet age; now we must do so within what Cal Newport calls a “lopsided arms race”. Each time we interact with an app or platform, we face off against billions of dollars and millions of hours poured into developing products that will maximize a single, dubious metric: our time spent online. This means that if we find ourselves struggling with binges, checking inboxes compulsively, or getting lost in endless scrolls, we deserve some real compassion and understanding -- we’re battling incredibly powerful forces. Our challenge, if we want to live well in the digital wilderness, is to give ourselves this charity while maintaining our sense of agency, power, and choice around how we relate to our digital tools.

Is his rhetorical foil of choice—Marx—a crypto-Epicurean? While any such comparison will be approximate, what Peterson and specifically the pre-1845 Marx share in common with these schools is their tendency to index subjectivity to differential conceptions of nature that in turn furnish us with directives for praxis. Yet should we survey the latter, post-1845 Marx, what we find is a problematization of this notion—one that leads him to posit the import of subjectivity as lying in the way its transitory emergence permits the resolution of particular historical impasses (as with the proletariat as “universal class”). This idea—of the Darwinian-Hegelian historical succession of universal classes/subjects—can, when applied to the current culture war, offer us insight into how we should go forward.\n\nRSVP for more sessions: www.thestoa.ca\nJoin The Stoa mailing list: https://thestoa.substack.com\nIntro song: Kali Yuga Blues by Bardo Pond\n\nThe Stoa is based on the gift economy.

In this three-part series, Tasshin will introduce you to loving kindness practice and help you to discover your own style of metta practice that resonates with you - your own form of \"weird metta.\" This series will culminate in the third and final session, a metta-focused dance party, so you can embody and enjoy your newfound, weird and wonderful loving-kindness skills with others.\n\nTo sign-up for part 3 (the dance party): https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJIpc--oqTIjHNSgzIrepz-2OgO13G2TJaEM\n\nThis recording is licensed with a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Instead of funnels and transactions, the weird-trepreneur builds playgrounds and open-ended explorations in which each person does their own thing and comes out weirder on the other side, and where their interactions are unpredictable and lasting, rather than \"transactional\".\n\nThe key thing to realize is that explorations and playgrounds are what we were looking for the whole time. They bring us home, rather than leaving us in an isolated consumer rat-race of false promises. They spread agency, rather than streamlining it away. They let us be ourselves rather than a consumer and rule-follower.\n\nSame-preneurship is the root of waste and depression in our society. And weird-trepreneurs will create new kinds of communities, venues, and organizations that will stop that waste and bring us alive again.\"\n\nMore: https://vbsd.super.site/introduction-for-culture-shifters\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

From Plato onwards, love both permits access to knowledge and presents a distraction to it. This week will examine the multiple types of Greek love - philia, eros, pragma, storge, philautia, ludus, agape, xenia - and suggest that our age has become unduly dominated by one particular idea of love - a combination of eros and possessiveness, love as a commodity. Against this, the love of the philosophers, past and present - love of the city, love that opens people up to the cosmos, will be presented as a critique of our narrow image. \n\nMore from Nina: https://ninapower.net\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

It is also one of the first things that we learn to silence in childhood, in order to ‘get along’ or to make things easier for the people around us. Is the will truly something to fear? Is it something that would unleash an unstoppable force of selfishness on the world? Or is it something deeper, connected to the wildness both inside ourselves and in nature, that is an expression of something vast, untamed, and beautiful.

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format.

Altruism refers to improving the lives of others—as opposed to egoism, which emphasizes only self-interest. Effectiveness refers to doing the most good with whatever resources are available—as opposed to only doing some amount of good—as well as determining what is the most good by using evidence and reasoning—as opposed to only doing what feels good or appears intuitively appealing.\"\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com","created":1603058400000,"persons":["f421ce3ba2165586b8cfa67e8d32687f"],"tags":["953d960c1aeabfb2a21a0dc737f5a01f"],"slug":"effective-altruism","part":null},"0168441b4837ad7af67f38184769ac5b":{"id":"_iuoBfs-vqFQ7BMyXO86a","hash":"0168441b4837ad7af67f38184769ac5b","youtubeId":"yxjNPZY5ELE","rawTitle":"The Metagame Mastermind w/ Khalil Martin (July 19, 2020)","title":"The Metagame Mastermind","body":"The metagame mastermind is a group discussion on \"digital gangs\" that will help people maintain their sovereignty and respond to the meta-crisis.\n\nRSVP for more sessions: www.thestoa.ca\nJoin The Stoa mailing list: https://thestoa.substack.com\nIntro song: Kali Yuga Blues by Bardo Pond\n\nSupport The Stoa @ patreon.com/the_stoa","created":1595976375000,"persons":["233d5cc7580fa73fd5ec8d22fe8f4f7f"],"tags":["96d4f86be8133cf5f88617d5b67e332f"],"slug":"the-metagame-mastermind-3","part":null,"series":["8fc4f686b7d98de51fb229e44bcc3043"]},"8dbc3dd616d0270f4abe6721fb81aaaf":{"id":"vhPmxMd6sBcF0QxyrGFtB","hash":"8dbc3dd616d0270f4abe6721fb81aaaf","youtubeId":"MT4FXml9uVw","rawTitle":"The Art and Science of Accessing Flow Consciousness w/ Justin Faerman","title":"The Art and Science of Accessing Flow Consciousness","body":"August 3rd, 2021\n\nJustin Faerman from the Flow Consciousness Institute visits The Stoa to discuss the art and science of accessing flow consciousness.\n\n\"The Flow Consciousness Institute offers a wide range of cutting-edge trainings that combine the latest research and tools from the fields of psychoneurobiology, neuroscience, quantum physics and parapsychology with time-honored wisdom from the great spiritual traditions and beyond. \"\n\nwww.justinfaerman.com\nwww.flowconsciousnessinstitute.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

A term documented by historian Richard Hofstadter in the 1960s, anti-intellectualism has returned with a vengeance in the 21st century. It refers to a general or specific distrust of experts, academics, and ideas, and can be found in laymen and intellectuals alike. From Trumpism to the Intellectual Dark Web, Rebel Wisdom to the Stoa itself, anti-intellectualism is a latent curse against our better collective judgement and community building. It is reason used as a weapon against reason. Understanding it as a long term trend as well as a present homegrown crisis is key to undoing its damage. The responsibility of intellectuals to \"speak truth and expose lies\" (Chomsky) is inherently risky and alienating, but avoiding or denying it is to be complicit in systemic evil.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We can continue to (or begin to) truly feel each other through the turbulence of these times. This is crucial to understanding ourselves, our place in the world, and the work that needs to be done. In this 2-hour workshop, we will learn to awaken subtle awareness and access the wisdom of the body in order to have more nuanced, intimate, coherent conversations and collaborations. We will journey into the subtle realms together, do some small group work, and dialogue about subtle body \"hygiene and maintenance.\" How can we become more exquisite and precise vessels for what wants to happen through us?\n\nBio: Schuyler brings a deep foundation of feminine and mystical wisdom--grounded in Buddhist Tantra and Western Alchemy--to her work with individuals and groups.

From Plato onwards, love both permits access to knowledge and presents a distraction to it. This week will examine the multiple types of Greek love - philia, eros, pragma, storge, philautia, ludus, agape, xenia - and suggest that our age has become unduly dominated by one particular idea of love - a combination of eros and possessiveness, love as a commodity. Against this, the love of the philosophers, past and present - love of the city, love that opens people up to the cosmos, will be presented as a critique of our narrow image. \n\nMore from Nina: https://ninapower.net\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The core idea is that one of these two subagents constructs a model of the \"world.\" The agent that constructs the world model is the conscious agent whose \"experiences\" represent the attention mechanism implemented by that agent. This model proposes a materialistic explanation of the distinction between Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness and proposes a solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The model also explains normal human consciousness, flow state, and enlightened \"self-less\" states of consciousness.\n\nIn Part 2 (of 2), on January 16th, Frank \"Explains Spirituality\" using a materialistic three-agent model of the brain; this model builds on the two-agent model of Part 1 presented on Jan 9th. If you didn't see that talk, please watch it on The Stoa YouTube channel or watch the 26-minute video on www.SpiritualityExplained.com. The core idea is that modern humans have developed a potent \"Thinker\" agent (the third agent of the three-agent model), which has enabled modern human civilization's attainments. Unfortunately, the Thinker often causes suffering for modern humans, and spirituality was developed to ameliorate that suffering.\n\nThe development of the more powerful Thinker agent in modern humans can clarify the distinctions between animal consciousness, normal human consciousness, flow state, and the various enlightened states of consciousness. This model also shows that common spiritual practices can result in decreased suffering. Some forms of spiritual practices allow the attainment of \"Enlightenment,\" which can eliminate the suffering caused by the Thinker. \n\nwww.SpiritualityExplained.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We ate up ghost stories and creepy villains.\n\nAs an adult, when someone spoils how the movie ends we get pissed off. We want the excitement of finding out how the mystery turns out. Why then, in this moment do we grasp for certainty?\n\nWill it save us from the fear inside?\n\nWe are told many lies about fear. I fell in every pothole created by these lies, and here’s what I know... The cure for the pain is in the pain. (Thanks, Rumi.)\n\nI’ve bumped my head on every rung of the ladder looking outside myself for certainty to escape that pain. I tried to outsource my sovereignty eight ways from Sunday – to healers, intuitives and exec coaches, and charismatic preachers. No, that didn’t work. I handed over my power to synchronicity to tell me what to do. No. I even found a way to over-rotate following my own damn ideas about how to be a “good” human.\n\nNo, no, and no.\n\nHow do you make the tough decisions in a time where nothing seems constant anymore, even the inside of your own head and heart?\n\nThis calibration is done via your body. It’s the needle of the compass on your emotional and energetic GPS. My card deck, Becoming Dragon, gives you a playful way through the pain. Inside every dark emotion (envy, shame, fear, etc) there is a gift. This deck takes you on a treasure hunt instead of staying stuck and suffering.\n\nAs Voodoo Donut says, “the magic is in the hole.”\n\nMore: https://www.crisbeasley.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format.

Do we want each other? Should we get married? What is love in a pandemic?\n\nSession 1: Love. What is love? Love is an ancient philosophical puzzle. From Plato onwards, love both permits access to knowledge and presents a distraction to it. This week will examine the multiple types of Greek love - philia, eros, pragma, storge, philautia, ludus, agape, xenia - and suggest that our age has become unduly dominated by one particular idea of love - a combination of eros and possessiveness, love as a commodity. Against this, the love of the philosophers, past and present - love of the city, love that opens people up to the cosmos, will be presented as a critique of our narrow image. \n\nMore from Nina: https://ninapower.net\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Segall","title":"The Spiritual Mission of America in the Anthropocene","body":"September 29, 2020\n\nIs the American experiment in multicultural capitalist democracy coming to an end? With identitarian illiberalisms rising on both its left and right flanks, can the flailing neoliberal world order regain its footing and fend off collapse? Even if liberal capitalism could reclaim the political legitimacy it once had and was able to wrestle power away from fascists and communists, it would still have to contend with the ecological disruption the modern industrial mode of production has caused to our own for too long forgotten ground: the Earth, or Gaia as I prefer to call her. We are now in the Anthropocene, meaning human history has become merged with geology. We've always been made of mud and thus part of the planet. But we are beginning to understand the misplaced concreteness of our old mechanical theories of Nature, and to recognize the consequences of the unsustainable practices these theories have informed. It has become clear that unless we want to become fossils, a fundamental transformation of our mode of production and social imaginary will be necessary. Liberalism, fascism, and communism are the three main attractors of modern politics. None of them has proven capable of dealing with the Gaian reality we now find ourselves inhabiting. In my talk, I'll draw on what has been called the \"immanental philosophies\" of the American pragmatist tradition (including Emerson, Peirce, James, Dewey, and Whitehead) to lay out several underlying system errors in the modern worldview and try to gesture toward the possibility of a non-modern, ecological alternative.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In this session Ashley will discuss her philosophical predisposition toward hands-on and embodied learning, and how that led her to build a field school for experiential learning in Uruguay. As the pandemic played out, Ashley turned to twitter and found a community of other practitioners, people trying their hands at a land-based existence, and she fell into the Homestead corner of twitter. She also noticed a whole other group of aspirational homesteaders, people worried about the world we are in, and trying to build a lifestyle that's both more resilient and more connected with others. Fundamentally a connector, Ashley will talk about how she sees the opportunity to make a Homestead Incubator class as pairing those experienced homesteaders with the aspirational ones. She will discuss her several overlapping goals for the class: 1. To give an overview of perspectives, heuristics, and lessons from experienced practitioners, 2. To encourage people to make friendships with both mentors and other students, 3. Build a repository of hands-on, practical advice, and 4. Start to build out an alumni network of both instructors/students that blossoms into a million different classes, workshops, regional support groups, and events. Come and ask Ashley your burning questions about homesteading, localism, and a resilient life!\n\nSign-up to the incubator here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfu0P9BNwVnXnZKLjFIKFiSzBmkrM4_X700y5Xf_QaUxSJ0OQ/viewform\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

There is too much tolerance on one hand, and too much contrarianism on the other, without any real literacy of critique and politics. While Socrates was executed for being a gadfly and trying to teach, today we see his legacy fetishized in practice, entry level philosophy, and conversational games. Meanwhile, the frame of philosophy of \"Western civilization\" and reason itself are crumbling, revealing a more complex social reality. In the attentional economy, we deprive people by ignoring, censoring, and demonizing through ingroup/ outgroup dynamics, sacrificing truth on the altar of egos. It's time hold up a mirror and stress test the leading sensemakers, so the chorus of protesting voices can be heard.\" - Brent Cooper\n\nRSVP for more sessions: www.thestoa.ca\nJoin The Stoa mailing list: https://thestoa.substack.com\nIntro song: Kali Yuga Blues by Bardo Pond\n\nThe Stoa is based on the gift economy.

In this text, four young authors of disparate positions among the political Left unite to show that Peterson’s attempt to address the contradictions characteristic of late-capitalist society ultimately conceals a more deeply-reactionary animus. And this animus can only be overcome if, rather than dismissing Peterson outright, we endeavour to understand why he came to exist in the first place.

It is a new type of civilisation: one which is replacing all previous human ways of living, cultures and value systems with something novel and totalising; something which, in some indefinable way, seems to be struggling to be born through us.

The Meta-Crisis Is Not in the Sky w/ Jonathan Rowson","title":"Don’t Look Up! The Meta-Crisis Is Not in the Sky","body":"January 24, 2022\n\nThe Netflix Film, Don't Look Up, is a comedy about a 'planet killer' comet spotted hurtling towards earth over a six month period and humanity's failure to deal with it despite having the knowledge and technology to do it. While the story can - and perhaps should - be viewed in many ways, it is widely considered to be about our failure to contend with ecological collapse due to climate change, despite knowing about the problem and roughly what needs to be done about it, for many decades. \n\nThose who dislike the film tend to find it shrill, exaggerated, unfunny, or think it is based on a bad analogy, or that it fails to offer a way out. But those who like the film tend to find it a uncannily close to life as we know it, a great metaphor that offers a refreshingly entertaining take on the nature of our predicament, and a timely challenge to reflect on the power dynamics, human waywardness and societal ruderlessness that arguably make mere 'calls to action' absurd. \n\nPerspectiva and The Stoa would like to give the film closer attention and to discuss it with our communities, starting with the suggestion that the movie is prismatic of what has been called our 'meta-crisis' -  a term with many framinings and definitions, but all concerned with the underlying dynamics within, behind, between and beyond surface phenomena. Indeed, it may be that the film is impressive precisely because it sets the agenda in style and substance for how to grasp the meta-crisis.\n\nTo make the most of this event, we request that everyone attending should watch Don't Look Up. We also strongly encourage everyone attending to either read Tasting the Pickle: Ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation or watch Jonathan Rowson's talk at The Stoa about it.\n\nhttps://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/\n\nDonate to Perspectiva: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=NS3TQYD4N6SZL\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport The Stoa: patreon.com/the_stoa","created":1642978800000,"persons":["ece67e3ef32b1b90da1c7563a90a5f1f"],"tags":["b6755d218d5f4e1cef9cce9cc39aeda9","9dc772d82afb9a5374668bd51a50cc8c","03462a41aec357b74c89eb8d272532f7"],"slug":"don't-look-up!-the-meta-crisis-is-not-in-the-sky","part":null},"853ed4cfe5ea8dd501ca8018a2af6379":{"id":"o9vKyZLlVZTV9STz44Hdw","hash":"853ed4cfe5ea8dd501ca8018a2af6379","youtubeId":"Q7uNt-HeWwE","rawTitle":"Afterlife: Is There Consciousness After Death? w/ Daniel Pinchbeck","title":"Afterlife","desc":" Is There Consciousness After Death?","body":"January 27, 2022\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck visits The Stoa to discuss his new book, Afterlife: Is There Consciousness After Death?\n\n\"In Afterlife, Is There Consciousness After Death?, New York Times bestselling author Daniel Pinchbeck (Breaking Open the Head, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl) builds the philosophical foundation for a new understanding and acceptance of our existence as souls and spirits within a larger continuum of consciousness, connecting contemporary scientific knowledge with ancient esoteric and shamanic wisdom traditions. Changing our relationship to the afterlife will also transform our relationship to this world. As the worldview of monistic or analytic idealism displaces the obsolete model of reductive materialism, the values of our civilization will also change profoundly.

The central idea is that our biosphere is facing an ecological emergency and that we have serious failings in other areas of public life that are preventing us from adequately addressing this emergency. Most notably, our political, socio-cultural, economic, and educational systems are all showing very serious failures, and thus we can consider each of these to be a distinct crisis in its own right. These crises are exacerbated by a breakdown in public sensemaking and by distortions within the information ecology. At the core is the so-called meaning crisis, which leads many people to confusion and alienation and an inability to find sufficient intelligibility and purpose within their lives.”\n\nhttps://medium.com/@brandon_29259/comparing-approaches-to-addressing-the-meta-crisis-9393e6ee17d7\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com","created":1644274800000,"persons":["dc05e4b5a547bd2aede461d65bd7b7e2"],"tags":["ae59810a44775738f120ae750ab1acd6","b6755d218d5f4e1cef9cce9cc39aeda9","9dc772d82afb9a5374668bd51a50cc8c"],"slug":"the-memetic-tribes-of-the-meta-crisis","part":null},"9952a736bfdfc307a287f3ddf948dee8":{"id":"p9rUSSJ3q5uaOM3NmiXVw","hash":"9952a736bfdfc307a287f3ddf948dee8","youtubeId":"ub02qqoaFoU","rawTitle":"The Cathedral w/ Curtis Yarvin","title":"The Cathedral","body":"April 18th, 2022\n\n\"The cathedral” is just a short way to say “journalism plus academia”—in other words, the intellectual institutions at the center of modern society, just as the Church was the intellectual institution at the center of medieval society.\"\n\nMore: https://graymirror.substack.com/p/a-brief-explanation-of-the-cathedral\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com","created":1650232800000,"persons":["4004b8a87eb7f12e9b66476545dec9c7"],"tags":["4d85f4cdc71f1b182cbb55513f24264b"],"slug":"the-cathedral","part":null},"77df080d3f891c367edb2de5ff375807":{"id":"0hFsobWRmcccSxe9dxjLC","hash":"77df080d3f891c367edb2de5ff375807","youtubeId":"Ea0rtx12aYc","rawTitle":"Beyond Self-Discipline Teaser","title":"Beyond Self-Discipline Teaser","body":"Starts April 1st, 2022\n\nhttps://maven.com/thewisdomgym/beyond-self-discipline\n\nVideo created by Reid Gower: www.youtube.com/c/ReidGower","created":1648764000000,"persons":[],"tags":["ad6e7652b1bdfb38783486c2c3d5e806","a2431e981e4accb290ff0668c97a126f"],"slug":"beyond-self-discipline-teaser","part":null},"c77f137cd321301f22086b384c5aeefc":{"id":"sXdUV1MKPw0cZ2kCNx5XX","hash":"c77f137cd321301f22086b384c5aeefc","youtubeId":"sTxuLoI80Vg","rawTitle":"Swarms, Egregores, and Autocults w/ John Robb, BJ Campbell, Patrick Ryan, and Jordan Hall","title":"Swarms, Egregores, and Autocults","body":"March 23rd, 2022\n\nJohn Robb, BJ Campbell, Patrick Ryan, and Jordan Hall engage in a dialogos to make sense of a new emerging entity in the noosphere.\n\nRecommended viewing/reading ...\n\nSwarms: https://youtu.be/kIFfwXuRwG0\nEgregores: https://hwfo.substack.com/p/memespace-egregores-and-nuclear-war\nAutocults: https://youtu.be/630qu6u7JN4\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com","created":1647990000000,"persons":["73ab551e3fcf8ea4079d665b58178197","3ded277d613023909f4703ef097eb025","f523be6b8921e1b0ea2b12c4da2a6bee","8fcd64c54bac026acd96091702819d37"],"tags":["d39cb0a5ea947b9bab556bd1f02bd416","17f4d3b339bdd1f6cf87b3e15a632c32","4c77b3b3f3eef507cc3fdf2cc8cee866"],"slug":"swarms-egregores-and-autocults","part":null},"2c92ce79209109b68b63f5bac106e26a":{"id":"ZeO3LXt_4IM0pDcSrnDq5","hash":"2c92ce79209109b68b63f5bac106e26a","youtubeId":"FlXxxdwQ2ME","rawTitle":"Truth, Trust, and Culture War w/ Zubin Damania, Christopher Kavanagh, Ben Burgis, and David Fuller","title":"Truth, Trust, and Culture War","body":"April 25th, 2022\n\nZubin Damania (ZDoggMD), Chris Kavanagh, Ben Burgis, and David Fuller visit The Stoa to discuss how truth, trust, and culture warring have shown up during the last two years of this pandemic.\n\nZubin: https://www.youtube.com/c/ZDoggMD\nChris: https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/\nBen: https://www.youtube.com/c/BenBurgisGTAA\nDavid: https://www.youtube.com/c/RebelWisdom\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com","created":1650837600000,"persons":["0d352f9e7983c1dd24254b382eaf5d98","0e9ece4b7d7cf56d6cdecac7d421c5d6","134c526c91f7365324f3b720fd728306","e12e397bd3c01890e691b738e519e4ac"],"tags":["2a51e262d3148a04a4f58661818704be","2f81eae07126287c59c259054052ddb9","b8297c8d25721774cf063b74670b172e"],"slug":"truth-trust-and-culture-war","part":null},"00d844ac86101fc58c0aa19ad5f06bf0":{"id":"G5fATWZWhaClbpQRtK49v","hash":"00d844ac86101fc58c0aa19ad5f06bf0","youtubeId":"kIFfwXuRwG0","rawTitle":"Global Guerrillas Report: Swarms vs Nukes w/ John Robb","title":"Global Guerrillas Report","desc":" Swarms vs Nukes","body":"March 4th, 2022\n\nJohn Robb visits The Stoa to discuss his latest Global Guerrillas Report on swarms vs nukes.\n\n\"The global, open-source movement, composed of nations, corporations, and individuals, has assembled in just a few days to oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Namely, he will share a theory of aesthetics. Aesthetics go much deeper than merely the preference one may have for clusters and correlations of sensorial patterns. Aesthetics, in fact, cut to the very root of our concept of identity. Inspired by Rob Burbea’s Soulmaking, Andrés will discuss how aesthetics can be broken down into: (1) Eros - the set of images that energize one’s thirst for life, (2) Psyche - the network of relationships between Eros imagery, and (3) Logos - the overarching ontology upon which Psyche and Eros are based. Andrés will discuss how these components emerge from specific philosophical background assumptions, are then adopted as social aesthetics, and ultimately risk becoming merely tribal markers. In so far as people are caught up in the dissonance between aesthetics without understanding the Logos that breaths life into them, they will continue to fight in unproductive ways. Ultimately, a careful map of the valence that an aesthetic associates to each symbol will allow us to create a *music theory* of aesthetics and liberate people from the burden of pointless memetic wars. Meaning that, we can predict in advance what kind of discussions are likely to break down due to different valences on key load-bearing symbols, and re-route them through a different path that nonetheless achieves the desired information processing. An understanding of how aesthetics bias our valuations would itself be an aesthetic, of course: the aesthetic of the meta-aesthetic. This talk will argue that such a meta-aesthetic could become the nexus that allows us to “get the best of each world”. The end-goal: to make aesthetic pluralism game-theoretically stable.

A black hole is a kind of hyperobject, a biosphere is another. But in the Anthropocene many of the hyperobjects that concern us have human origins. For example, global warming. Or antibiotics.

Hypersubjects are typically, but not exclusively white, male, northern, well-nourished, and modern in all senses of the term.

They command and control; they seek transcendence; they get very high on their own supply of dominion. Do you want to know what is irritating hypersubjects today?

A growing number of people and initiatives are taking alternative approaches to social change. These approaches diverge from and go beyond the more established spaces in civil society and the social economy.\n\nThis ecosystem is still emerging and ill-defined. Reflecting this, there has been no clear name for it and we have settled for now on the label “Metamodernist”. As mapped so far it is quite broad – even disparate. Nevertheless, there are commonalities.\n\nMost importantly, this ecosystem has a novel approach to social change. Specifically, an approach that is simultaneously paradigmatic, integrated, and engaged.\n\nSecondly, there are a variety of commonalities in outlook and approach. The most noteworthy identified so far we have termed: post-individualism, (w)holism and culture-making (in the form of new norms and narratives).\nThere is also a focus on complexity, systems and emergence, on developmental models, spirituality and practice, and on sensemaking, different forms of knowledge and global-local activism. Other commonalities include an interest in decentralized governance, new narratives, alternative social imaginaries and regenerative culture.\n\nMore at https://ecosystem.lifeitself.us\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com","created":1646780400000,"persons":["b305d232dd7dc2a55ebd8b5d316075bd","a638c598f6441ed0749149a81c29584a"],"tags":["cbddf29b6030c1afa14d3e91ed5bda65","1ff5cc20cabe9e030a3ee41d46be7ada","47e3170ffb3d6c316975632968933646"],"slug":"mapping-metamodern-charting-an-emerging-\"metamodern\"-ecosystem","part":null},"fe892717a929a2148b8f3b99a58a8e1d":{"id":"AMRzLLFQBFNXPyUhMyRjD","hash":"fe892717a929a2148b8f3b99a58a8e1d","youtubeId":"UdelrA74Dxs","rawTitle":"Living with the Global Problematique w/ Peter Jones","title":"Living with the Global Problematique","body":"October 9th, 2020\n\nPeter Jones, Faculty of Design at OCAD University, visits The Sota to deliver a talk followed by a Q&A.\n\nFifty years ago the Club of Rome defined their major agenda based on a prospectus by Hasan Özbekhan, The Predicament of Mankind. He presented a Global Problematique, where he defined 49 Continuous Critical Problems as rapidly merging into a single megacrisis. However, the Club of Rome chose to fund the Limits to Growth project and not Özbekhan’s pitch, since the Forrester and Meadows’ team had cool tech of system dynamics modeling. As Özbekhan foresaw, the Problematique continues, and we live within the complex entailments of increasing population, growth economy, technological efficiency, etc. But unlike 1970, we now have methods for engaging with social systems, and reflecting on our own traps of “problem solving” traps that we know only perpetuate these superwicked problems. Peter draws your inquiry together about the nature of today’s problematique, how we can live together in the future as it continues, and what tools we have or can create to buffer and intervene as the complex Megacrisis continues.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We will be discussing his new book: A Generation’s Worth: Spirit Work While the Crisis Reigns\n\n“A Generation’s Worth started out as a bit of stenography, transcribing a quartet of livestream sessions. Those notes met the realities of covid 19, the lockdowns and upheavals, and turned into something of a plague document.

The best-known environmentalists are not in the business of speaking truth, or even holding up rational solutions to blunt the impending ecocide, but instead indulge in a mendacious and self-serving delusion that provides comfort at the expense of reality.

Then ordinary people can come out a play for a bit. Dark age for some, but not for others…” We hope to debate the question of a sustainable diet and best strategies for achieving agricultural diversity in a world where environmental policy makers increasingly call for a global diet.

She will describe the 5 steps of trigger work and then guide participants in some exercises from the book—exercises that teach you how to catch and calm trigger reactions so you can get back to being present and resourceful. Doing these exercises will help you heal your fear of emotional discomfort and allow you to handle situations you used to avoid.\n\n Here is an excerpt from the book: “Your trigger reactions can be the doorway to understanding and embodying a much bigger life process that I like to call whole-making. As I see it, life itself is about whole-making —integrating the various parts of a system into increasingly interrelated wholes. Our trigger reactions help us see aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of. As we explore these reactions, we discover parts of ourselves that have been denied, abandoned, or repressed.

She will describe the 5 steps of trigger work and then guide participants in some exercises from the book—exercises that teach you how to catch and calm trigger reactions so you can get back to being present and resourceful. Doing these exercises will help you heal your fear of emotional discomfort and allow you to handle situations you used to avoid.\n\n Here is an excerpt from the book: “Your trigger reactions can be the doorway to understanding and embodying a much bigger life process that I like to call whole-making. As I see it, life itself is about whole-making —integrating the various parts of a system into increasingly interrelated wholes. Our trigger reactions help us see aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of. As we explore these reactions, we discover parts of ourselves that have been denied, abandoned, or repressed. This is the realm of the human unconscious that psychologists call our shadow. As we enter through this portal, we encounter forgotten hurts and disappointments, unmet childhood needs, protective personality habits that we adopted to keep us safe, beliefs that help us make sense of things we don’t understand, and ideas about ourselves and others that feed the insecure ego’s need to be knowledgeable, good, or right.

It helps you love yourself and others more fully.

In the pictures, it is so clear what they were countering: The Man, of course, who, with his white collar, white skin, and short hair, singlehandedly symbolized dominant cultural norms. In the age of social media, personal expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear, as if dressing middle-class, white, and preppy still aligned with the rules of power today.\n\nIn an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes all who live within the Google/Apple/Facebook/ Amazon digital ecosystem (aka GAFA stack).

In the pictures, it is so clear what they were countering: The Man, of course, who, with his white collar, white skin, and short hair, singlehandedly symbolized dominant cultural norms. In the age of social media, personal expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear, as if dressing middle-class, white, and preppy still aligned with the rules of power today.\n\nIn an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes all who live within the Google/Apple/Facebook/ Amazon digital ecosystem (aka GAFA stack).

What kind of subcultures can emerge in this panorama? How do we understand and engage with the ghosts, poltergeists and egregores of the world-wide web? In crafts like carpentry, it is said that there is a will, a wisdom inherent in the material itself - that the possibility for the finished product already exists, latent, in the wood. What is then latent in the prima materia of human attention? What is Art, in this context? And what kind of darkness must we face in order to stare it dead in the eye?\n\nJoin us for a trip to the underworld - if you can handle it.\n\n***\n\nRead more about ontological design here: https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-manifesto-of-ontological-design-7fdb19169107\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport stealing the culture: patreon.com/the_stoa\nReceive coaching with resonance: https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches"}}},"BL9X4UKeuVo":{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"zsRwHjv8dF2IzaF5oelxaz8oRHk","id":"BL9X4UKeuVo","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2021-06-26T00:33:25Z","channelId":"UCfI5jzpoUbwP4wkmQ6ZNqbA","title":"The Elusive I w/ John Vervaeke, Gregg Henriques, and Christopher Mastropietro","description":"June 24th, 2021\n\nJohn, Gregg, and Chris return to The Stoa to conclude their dialogos series with a Q&A.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.”\n\nPeter Wang, entreprenur, former physicist, and student of the human condition, returns to The Stoa to as a \"Sensemaker in Residence” for the month of September. Peter will discuss the mental models he personally uses to navigate life and all of its complexities.

We are guided to introspect on our thinking and behaviour, to make connections between our past and our present circumstances, and to learn how to let go of the past and make positive changes.\n\nHowever, because the effects of trauma and conditioning are actually held physically - in the body - they may also be addressed in that environment.\n\nWorking with the body in this manner also removes the biases that can come from living in an environment where there is much subtle and non-subtle influencing about how we &quot;should be.&quot; Understanding that we are blocked, we can simply work to remove the blocks, knowing that whatever remains will be a more pure version of our authentic self.\n\nIn Bioenergetics, we put our body into specific postures and then endeavour to maintain the posture, whilst breathing deeply through the mouth and remaining intimately in touch with the felt sense of the body.

We are guided to introspect on our thinking and behaviour, to make connections between our past and our present circumstances, and to learn how to let go of the past and make positive changes.\n\nHowever, because the effects of trauma and conditioning are actually held physically - in the body - they may also be addressed in that environment.\n\nWorking with the body in this manner also removes the biases that can come from living in an environment where there is much subtle and non-subtle influencing about how we &quot;should be.&quot; Understanding that we are blocked, we can simply work to remove the blocks, knowing that whatever remains will be a more pure version of our authentic self.\n\nIn Bioenergetics, we put our body into specific postures and then endeavour to maintain the posture, whilst breathing deeply through the mouth and remaining intimately in touch with the felt sense of the body. At some point, holding patterns from the muscle system begin to release.\n\nThe aim of Bioenergetics is to leave you feeling more grounded and more open, better able to hold safe boundaries and simultaneously more okay with being vulnerable.\n\nSession Timetable:\n-Introduction to Bioenergetics and the session - 15 mins\n-Guided Bioenergetics session - 30 mins\n-Q&A - 30 mins\n\nPlease wear loose clothing and take responsibility to not be intoxicated.\n\nSome of the exercises will require a small amount of sound, perhaps grunting or similar.

In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows.\n\nIn this session Ashley and Jason will tell the story of the birth of Doomer Optimism on Twitter, and ask the participants of the session to co-create the definition and examples of what Doomer Optimism might come to represent. The goal of this session is to set the stage, define terms and expectations, and begin the formation of a big tent community.\n\nThis session will be the first part of a Doomer Optimist Series hosted by Ashley and Jason. The series will start by interviewing some public intellectuals, asking them to bring their perspective to bear on Doomer Optimism.

In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows.\n\nIn this session Ashley and Jason will tell the story of the birth of Doomer Optimism on Twitter, and ask the participants of the session to co-create the definition and examples of what Doomer Optimism might come to represent. The goal of this session is to set the stage, define terms and expectations, and begin the formation of a big tent community.\n\nThis session will be the first part of a Doomer Optimist Series hosted by Ashley and Jason. The series will start by interviewing some public intellectuals, asking them to bring their perspective to bear on Doomer Optimism. The series will then hold several panels of doomer optimists, making some space to ask questions, solve problems, and make plans. We don't know what we will find or create with the Doomer Optimist series, but the only way out is through. Join us!\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The core idea is that one of these two subagents constructs a model of the \"world.\" The agent that constructs the world model is the conscious agent whose \"experiences\" represent the attention mechanism implemented by that agent. This model proposes a materialistic explanation of the distinction between Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness and proposes a solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The model also explains normal human consciousness, flow state, and enlightened \"self-less\" states of consciousness.\n\nIn Part 2 (of 2), on January 16th, Frank \"Explains Spirituality\" using a materialistic three-agent model of the brain; this model builds on the two-agent model of Part 1 presented on Jan 9th. If you didn't see that talk, please watch it on The Stoa YouTube channel or watch the 26-minute video on www.SpiritualityExplained.com. The core idea is that modern humans have developed a potent \"Thinker\" agent (the third agent of the three-agent model), which has enabled modern human civilization's attainments. Unfortunately, the Thinker often causes suffering for modern humans, and spirituality was developed to ameliorate that suffering.\n\nThe development of the more powerful Thinker agent in modern humans can clarify the distinctions between animal consciousness, normal human consciousness, flow state, and the various enlightened states of consciousness. This model also shows that common spiritual practices can result in decreased suffering.

A term documented by historian Richard Hofstadter in the 1960s, anti-intellectualism has returned with a vengeance in the 21st century. It refers to a general or specific distrust of experts, academics, and ideas, and can be found in laymen and intellectuals alike. From Trumpism to the Intellectual Dark Web, Rebel Wisdom to the Stoa itself, anti-intellectualism is a latent curse against our better collective judgement and community building. It is reason used as a weapon against reason. Understanding it as a long term trend as well as a present homegrown crisis is key to undoing its damage. The responsibility of intellectuals to \"speak truth and expose lies\" (Chomsky) is inherently risky and alienating, but avoiding or denying it is to be complicit in systemic evil.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

As the pandemic played out, Ashley turned to twitter and found a community of other practitioners, people trying their hands at a land-based existence, and she fell into the Homestead corner of twitter. She also noticed a whole other group of aspirational homesteaders, people worried about the world we are in, and trying to build a lifestyle that's both more resilient and more connected with others. Fundamentally a connector, Ashley will talk about how she sees the opportunity to make a Homestead Incubator class as pairing those experienced homesteaders with the aspirational ones. She will discuss her several overlapping goals for the class: 1. To give an overview of perspectives, heuristics, and lessons from experienced practitioners, 2. To encourage people to make friendships with both mentors and other students, 3. Build a repository of hands-on, practical advice, and 4.

The Meta-Crisis Is Not in the Sky w/ Jonathan Rowson","description":"January 24, 2022\n\nThe Netflix Film, Don't Look Up, is a comedy about a 'planet killer' comet spotted hurtling towards earth over a six month period and humanity's failure to deal with it despite having the knowledge and technology to do it. While the story can - and perhaps should - be viewed in many ways, it is widely considered to be about our failure to contend with ecological collapse due to climate change, despite knowing about the problem and roughly what needs to be done about it, for many decades. \n\nThose who dislike the film tend to find it shrill, exaggerated, unfunny, or think it is based on a bad analogy, or that it fails to offer a way out. But those who like the film tend to find it a uncannily close to life as we know it, a great metaphor that offers a refreshingly entertaining take on the nature of our predicament, and a timely challenge to reflect on the power dynamics, human waywardness and societal ruderlessness that arguably make mere 'calls to action' absurd. \n\nPerspectiva and The Stoa would like to give the film closer attention and to discuss it with our communities, starting with the suggestion that the movie is prismatic of what has been called our 'meta-crisis' -  a term with many framinings and definitions, but all concerned with the underlying dynamics within, behind, between and beyond surface phenomena. Indeed, it may be that the film is impressive precisely because it sets the agenda in style and substance for how to grasp the meta-crisis.\n\nTo make the most of this event, we request that everyone attending should watch Don't Look Up. We also strongly encourage everyone attending to either read Tasting the Pickle: Ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation or watch Jonathan Rowson's talk at The Stoa about it.\n\nhttps://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/\n\nDonate to Perspectiva: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=NS3TQYD4N6SZL\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport The Stoa: patreon.com/the_stoa","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YJ9c4Az9q-g/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YJ9c4Az9q-g/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YJ9c4Az9q-g/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"channelTitle":"The Stoa","categoryId":"22","liveBroadcastContent":"none","localized":{"title":"Don’t Look Up!

We also strongly encourage everyone attending to either read Tasting the Pickle: Ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation or watch Jonathan Rowson's talk at The Stoa about it.\n\nhttps://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/\n\nDonate to Perspectiva: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=NS3TQYD4N6SZL\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport The Stoa: patreon.com/the_stoa"}}},"Q7uNt-HeWwE":{"kind":"youtube#video","etag":"x3_HCjBdZFbBGo1bWJacco09mJQ","id":"Q7uNt-HeWwE","snippet":{"publishedAt":"2022-01-28T01:30:05Z","channelId":"UCfI5jzpoUbwP4wkmQ6ZNqbA","title":"Afterlife: Is There Consciousness After Death? w/ Daniel Pinchbeck","description":"January 27, 2022\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck visits The Stoa to discuss his new book, Afterlife: Is There Consciousness After Death?\n\n\"In Afterlife, Is There Consciousness After Death?, New York Times bestselling author Daniel Pinchbeck (Breaking Open the Head, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl) builds the philosophical foundation for a new understanding and acceptance of our existence as souls and spirits within a larger continuum of consciousness, connecting contemporary scientific knowledge with ancient esoteric and shamanic wisdom traditions.

Aesthetics, in fact, cut to the very root of our concept of identity.
