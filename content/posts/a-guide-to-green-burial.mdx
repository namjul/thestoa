Caitlyn Hauke, PhD is the current President of the Board of Directors of the Green Burial Council International, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to inspire and advocate for environmentally sustainable, natural death care through education and certification.Â 

Caitlyn visits The Stoa to discuss how to have an eco-friendly, ethical, and compassionate green burial. She will describe the criteria, characteristics, and considerations of choosing a green burial and how this choice returns the body to the earth simply and naturally with minimal environmental impact.
