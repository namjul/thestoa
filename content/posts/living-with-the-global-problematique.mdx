Peter Jones, Faculty of Design at OCAD University, visits The Sota to deliver a talk followed by a Q&A.

Fifty years ago the Club of Rome defined their major agenda based on a prospectus by Hasan Özbekhan, The Predicament of Mankind. He presented a Global Problematique, where he defined 49 Continuous Critical Problems as rapidly merging into a single megacrisis. However, the Club of Rome chose to fund the Limits to Growth project and not Özbekhan’s pitch, since the Forrester and Meadows’ team had cool tech of system dynamics modeling. As Özbekhan foresaw, the Problematique continues, and we live within the complex entailments of increasing population, growth economy, technological efficiency, etc. But unlike 1970, we now have methods for engaging with social systems, and reflecting on our own traps of “problem solving” traps that we know only perpetuate these superwicked problems. Peter draws your inquiry together about the nature of today’s problematique, how we can live together in the future as it continues, and what tools we have or can create to buffer and intervene as the complex Megacrisis continues.
