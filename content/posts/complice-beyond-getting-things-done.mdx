 Beyond Getting Things Done

Tue Dec 22 2020

This session was a part of The Unsuccess Symposium: Let Us Get Successful So We Can Stop Giving a Shit About Getting Successful on December 22nd, 2020.

Virtually all to-do list software on the internet, whether it knows it or not, is based on the workflow and philosophy called GTD (David Allen’s “Getting Things Done”). Complice is different. It wasn’t created as a critique of GTD, but it’s easiest to describe it by contrasting it with this implicit default so many people are used to. Here are 4 values that Complice emphasizes, contrasted with GTD:

- choosing & doing, over organizing
- aliveness, instead of exhaustiveness
- goals as fundamental, rather than tasks
- proactive, moreso than reactive
