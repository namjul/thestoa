 Sutra to Tantra

Sun Jul 05 2020

July 5th, 2020

Degenerate fuckwits, Charlie Awbery & Jared Janes lead a collective exploration of how Vajrayana practice might manifest in multi-cultural, contemporary times. This session will focus on the difference between the Sutric (renunciative) & Tantric (transformative) stances of Buddhist practice with an emphasis on facilitating/supporting meditators who want to practice outside of the renunciative frame of reference.
