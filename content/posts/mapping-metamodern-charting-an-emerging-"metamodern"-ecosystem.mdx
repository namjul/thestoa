 Charting an Emerging “Metamodern” Ecosystem

Wed Mar 09 2022

March 9th, 2022

For a longer event description we could run with this (from the site itself):
A new ecosystem, or ecosystem of ecosystems, is emerging. A growing number of people and initiatives are taking alternative approaches to social change. These approaches diverge from and go beyond the more established spaces in civil society and the social economy.

This ecosystem is still emerging and ill-defined. Reflecting this, there has been no clear name for it and we have settled for now on the label “Metamodernist”. As mapped so far it is quite broad – even disparate. Nevertheless, there are commonalities.

Most importantly, this ecosystem has a novel approach to social change. Specifically, an approach that is simultaneously paradigmatic, integrated, and engaged.

Secondly, there are a variety of commonalities in outlook and approach. The most noteworthy identified so far we have termed: post-individualism, (w)holism and culture-making (in the form of new norms and narratives).
There is also a focus on complexity, systems and emergence, on developmental models, spirituality and practice, and on sensemaking, different forms of knowledge and global-local activism. Other commonalities include an interest in decentralized governance, new narratives, alternative social imaginaries and regenerative culture.
