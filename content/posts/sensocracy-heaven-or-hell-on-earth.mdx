 Heaven or Hell on Earth?

Thu Nov 12 2020

November 12th, 2020

Sensocracy is the unavoidable replacement of politics as we know it, when sensors tied to our senses around the planet will measure our preferences every second rather than every four years or so in a voting booth. The difference from today's politics will be at least as radical as the difference between monarchy and democracy as we have known them. But will sensocracy be a central computer A.I. police-state dictatorship, as currently planned in Communist China, or can the rest of the world respond with a properly developed concept of a sensocracy that remains free, open and creative? The key is who controls the algorithms, will that be you and your own tribe, or will that be algorithms corrupted by desperate capital and manipulated by invasive political correctness that instead control your mind?
