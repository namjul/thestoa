A hollow is a natural landscape feature where people gather in secret.

It is a low-lying wooded, often riverine place. A hollow is also a whole in a large tree where animals gather. It resonates with the notion of "emptiness" and "hollow" it is the opposite of reification. When we think we have a memory in our mind, as if we could open our heads and find it there, when instead, our minds are “hollow" …

In these sessions Bonnitta will move us away from reification and into the hollow.
