Liam Kavanagh visits The Stoa to deliver a talk on the "equality complex". This will be followed by a Q&A.

"We are taught to be equals, but not to be average. Rather, we are told to distinguish ourselves in all ways, including morally. This includes putting ourselves above others by standing for equality more resolutely. We'll explore this increasingly untenable contradiction woven into Western moral life. Being less egotistical is one way of addressing this tension, but I'll explore a more taboo, route. We can recognise that ideals of equality offer an amazingly effective moral ‘rule of thumb’, but have, unhealthily, become enshrined as the truth, taboo to even question. They have also become a very unsatisfactory replacement for compassion and love, which in more ‘spiritual’ times were the center of moral life, with consequences that may be truly disastrous when considered alongside issues such as climate chaos."
