Metamodern Magick is a cross-disciplinary framework that seeks to enrich every individual's knowledge of self and sense of being in the world through individual and communal ritual practice.

Drawing from the work of John Vervaeke, Gregg Henriques, Marie-Louise von Franz, and Catherine Bell (among others), it encompasses axioms and psychotechnologies from all major epistemes of human history--synthesising and recontextualising ancient and conventional wisdom for a post-postmodern world.

The system of Metamodern Magick was first cultivated by theory and ritual artist Scoutleader Wiley.
