Kaliya Young, the Identity Woman (identitywoman.net) visits The Stoa to discuss internet identity and our digital selves.

From Kaliya: "I have written several books on digital identity that demystify the field and help newcomers become active contributors. I have been a key builder and supporter of the global community of digital identity architects, gathering network and cross-field expertise along the way. I have correctly predicted the development of digital identity infrastructures and continue to be forward-looking in my work."
