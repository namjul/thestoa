The speed and dissociation of the cultural waters we swim in make subtle body awareness a superpower. We can continue to (or begin to) truly feel each other through the turbulence of these times. This is crucial to understanding ourselves, our place in the world, and the work that needs to be done. In this 2-hour workshop, we will learn to awaken subtle awareness and access the wisdom of the body in order to have more nuanced, intimate, coherent conversations and collaborations. We will journey into the subtle realms together, do some small group work, and dialogue about subtle body "hygiene and maintenance." How can we become more exquisite and precise vessels for what wants to happen through us?
