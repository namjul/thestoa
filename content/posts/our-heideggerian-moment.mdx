The current crisis - simultaneously a health crisis, an economic crisis, a political crisis, and a crisis of world-order - presents us with an opportunity to reexamine some basic concepts and assumptions about ourselves, the systems in which we live, and the usual ways we interpret the events happening with us and around us. This talk argues for the relevance of Martin Heidegger's philosophy of another beginning in understanding and overcoming the crisis.
