Something new is afoot. In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows. The localists talk about homesteading and small farms, the bioregionalists talk about healing ecological trauma and living within the limits of the earth, the decentralization movement talks about currency protocols and smart contracts, and the metamodernists talk about stage theory while drinking lattes from their urban condos. In this session we will discuss what these movements have in common, and how they can put aside their differences, synthesize their perspectives while not always liking each other, and unite to save the planet while solving our precious meaning crisis too.
