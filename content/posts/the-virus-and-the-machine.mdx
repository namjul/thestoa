Paul Kingsnorth visits The Stoa to discuss his “vaccination moment” and his musings on The Machine.

“What I have been calling the Machine is not simply the logical endpoint of certain trends within culture and history. It is not simply a collection of advanced tools, historical designs and political power games. It is that, but it is also something else. It is a new type of civilisation: one which is replacing all previous human ways of living, cultures and value systems with something novel and totalising; something which, in some indefinable way, seems to be struggling to be born through us. Something which we are midwifing into existence every time we click and swipe, whether we know it or not. The question is how we can begin to understand it.”
