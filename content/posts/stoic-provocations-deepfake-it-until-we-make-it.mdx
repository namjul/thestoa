Stoic Provocations is a new series that affords us the opportunity to practice our Stoicism. A speaker visits us, shares some edgy thoughts that put us at the edge of our thinking. We possibly get triggered, stop the recording and get into a collective dialogue, with a little twist ...

Can deepfakes be used in ethical and benevolent ways? Are we willing to let the villain become the hero? Might transcending our post-truth crisis require us to relax our relationship with truth? These are the provocations that will be posed to us by Stephanie Lepp, artist and cultural trickster whose work strives to hold up a mirror â€” inviting us to grow from what we see. She's the producer of Deep Reckonings, a series of explicitly-marked deepfakes that imagine Mark Zuckerberg, Brett Kavanaugh, and Alex Jones having a reckoning (www.deepreckonings.com) and Reckonings, a podcast that explores how people shift their political worldviews, transcend extremism, and make other kinds of transformative change.
