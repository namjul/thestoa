Eric Garza visits The Stoa to discuss the concept called "Traumacene." 

"I prefer to call this era the Traumacene to center the cause of the destructiveness and domination rather than its symptoms. At one level the cause is disconnection, and beneath that level festers trauma accumulated over countless generations of conflict and hardship that our grieving practices failed to heal. By centering the cause, we also name a path forwards: healing our individual and cultural trauma. While this path is by no means easy and may invite us to flirt, from time to time, with the despair and self-loathing we would rather avoid, know these are but stopping points on a longer journey rather than endpoints in themselves."
