Session 1: Ancestry

"Our project is guided by the question: what is regeneration and what is it summoning us to? For us, regeneration is not just a set of alternative solutions - nor is it just about nature. Instead, regeneration is about activating the capability and will to shift unhealthy ingrained patterns so that we can step into our innate potential as stewards of life. Regeneration involves relationality and the ability to cultivate it towards higher orders of complexity. We are co-evolutionary participants with this world and regeneration is about bringing that into awareness and practice again - caring for and taking responsibility for our commons. Soul Shivers is a multimedia dialogue series dedicated to weaving disparate voices of women from around the world in service of collective regeneration. Twice a year, we gather four women around four themes and collectively support the dialogues with multimedia expressions seen in art, poetry, letters, and more. The themes we will explore are (1) ancestry (2) trauma (3) connection to place and (4) peace. " - Freya and Luea
