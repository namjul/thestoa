Full title: The Problems with the Sensemaking Scene: Imagining Beyond the Echo Chamber

Tarn and Ellie are two insiders in the ‘sense-making scene’ who have seen the good, the bad and the ugly. In this session, they will talk about some of the problems they've observed, while also presenting us with new fresh ideas and pathways for how to reimagine the current conversation.

Or, in jargon-speak: Tarn and Ellie are here to host a sense-making session in which they will provide a situational analysis of the metamodern memetic tribe and its shadows, and discuss how we might be able to move towards a more holistic and generative conversation that can bring us closer to stewarding the birth of the first non self-terminating planetary civilisation.

Boys, we need to talk.

See you at the campfire.
