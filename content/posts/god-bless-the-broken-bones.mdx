Stoic author William Ferraiolo, visits The Stoa to discuss his new book: God Bless the Broken Bones: Meditations Over One Botched, Bungled, and Beautiful Year. The session is hosted by Michael Tremblay. 

"You can learn a lot about yourself if you pay careful attention for one full year. Here are 365 daily meditations that, through their brutal confessionalism, will unearth the stoic in you. 'God Bless the Broken Bones won’t tickle your ears with pleasant words. Instead what you’ll find is a year of one man’s seemingly uncensored thoughts, fears, frustrations, longings, gratitude, and self-exhortations."
