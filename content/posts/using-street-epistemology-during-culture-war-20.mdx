Street Epistemologist extraordinaire, Anthony Magnabosco, visits The Stoa to deliver a talk on Street Epistemology and its function during our new culture war, followed by a discussion. 

What is Street Epistemology? "While definitions vary, it's generally accepted that Street Epistemology is a conversational tool that helps people reflect on the quality of their reasons and the reliability of their methods used to derive one's confidence level in their deeply-held beliefs."
