This series is a part of The Stoa's "Communitas Club."

Jill DeTemple, Professor of Religious Studies at Southern Methodist University, visits The Stoa to discuss the "Reflective Structured Dialogue."

"Reflective Structured Dialogue (RSD), is designed to help communities and organizations disrupt those patterns to hold open, honest, constructive conversations about potentially divisive topics."
