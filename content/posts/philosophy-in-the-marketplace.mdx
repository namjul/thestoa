From Mahmoud: “I finished my Ph.D. in Philosophy at the University of Salamanca Spain. Between 2013 and 2020, I taught philosophy and cultural studies at the American University of Beirut and the Lebanese American University. Now, I decided to venture into the virtual world in order to give online courses to people who are interested in studying philosophy in a non-academic setting.”
