Sarah Perry, a contributing editor at Ribbonfarm and the author of Every Cradle is a Grave, visits The Stoa to discuss ignorance studies.

From Sarah: "introducing the ethnomethodology/indexicality stuff and the problems with science and knowledge that it implies, and connecting that to a bunch of other stuff (history of psychology, tacit knowledge transfer on youtube, color mixing, etc.)"
Should be fun!
