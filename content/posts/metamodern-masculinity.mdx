September 7th, 2020

What does it mean to be a man in 2020? What are the virtues, vices, and struggles of masculinity? How do we reconcile modern ideals of strength, stoicism, and warrior-ship with postmodern critiques of dominance, repression, and violence?

Arran opens up the zoomscape for a discussion on masculinity in a metamodern world. Come share in this collective sense-making session where all voices are welcome!"

The intro was only recorded. If you'd like to be apart of the conversation you can sign-up for the next Metamodern Masculinity session here: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJArcOCoqTsoG9azrc03MR-A_u-1n5THHulj
