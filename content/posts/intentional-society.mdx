Founded January 2021, Intentional Society now has 50+ community gatherings under their belt. Come for a synthesis of their developmental, relational, and community-building lessons learned so far, then stick around for a fun taster experience of some relational practices.

Background: Intentional Society is a community for people who want to grow â€” to be the people we want to be, in spacious relationship with ourselves, with others, and with systems. We practice relationally at our edges of being and becoming, focused with a developmental lens, within a safe and supportive community container, with core values of acceptance, awareness, and authenticity. As a Liminal Web node, we sit right between the "Authentic Relating & Microsolidarity" and "Developmentalists" subcultures. More description at https://www.intentionalsociety.org
