From the perspective of Western psychology loss of some one we are close to results in both normal and complicated bereavement. We will review the most cynically effective protocols to work through and settle the grieving process. From the perspective of Tibetan Bon and Buddhist meditation practices, the practitioner prepares for dying by practicing consciousness-transferences. While dying there are three after-death statesâ€”the state of the actual dying practice, the state of the sound and light show of the dharmahatu, and the state determining rebirth. The advanced practitioner learns to carry meditation practice into these three after-death states, so as to use the dying process as an opportunity to complete Buddhahood. The most advanced practitioner uses the dying process to dissolve the residual substantiality of the physical body upon dying, so as to achieve great consciousness-transference or rainbow body. Through these practices the meditator gains voluntary control over the dying process and can emanate in any form and any place according to intention.
