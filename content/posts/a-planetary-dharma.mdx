John Churchill visits The Stoa to discuss a planetary dharma.

“At this moment in history the deep archetypal structures of the Eastern and Western psyches are meeting. In this creative confluence a planetary synthesis, a fourth turning of the dharma wheel is unfolding.

Planetary Dharma, is a contribution to this global endeavor, a fourth-turning Trans-Himalayan teaching that synthesizes Buddhist & Hindu contemplative science, psychodynamic integration, plant medicine work, embodiment, adult ego-development, and esotericism into a Western Bodhisattva path of action and community development for the 21st century.

When the path of the Bodhisattva, the awakening warrior, and their path of freedom and fulfillment through service to all, is grounded in a contemporary view of a sacred world we then find a universal vision that goes beyond Buddhism itself. It is a vision of Interbeing, the deep interdependence that we share with an interconnected holonic kosmos in all its planes of expression.

This universal way is a teaching for our time, it is deeply humanistic, planetary in its scope, aspirational in its vision of possibility, and calls us to a heroic altruism based on an evolved perspective of what it means to be a true human-being in relationship with one another.”
