Embodiment Hour: Feeling is healing. Join Schuyler Brown for an embodied discussion about a piece of current media or culture. We’ll practice working with somatic awareness and emotional intelligence to unpack how we’re really feeling about what’s going on right now. The space is open to all who wish to practice sensing and communicating feelings; to feel and be felt; to see and be seen.

In this session we watched a clip from the recently released An Initiation to Game B: https://youtu.be/E_cyCuCKQhs
