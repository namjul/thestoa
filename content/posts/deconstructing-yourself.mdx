Michael Taft from Deconstructing Yourself visits The Stoa.

"Deconstructing Yourself was created to share the life changing force that is meditation. We strive to extend beyond any particular religion or technique in order to welcome anyone into our community. Our original articles, podcasts, and videos are created with honesty and curiosity, in hopes of encouraging, informing, and inspiring your meditation practice. And we definitely donâ€™t shy away from being controversial." https://deconstructingyourself.com
