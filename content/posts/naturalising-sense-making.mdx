This is a part of The Stoa's "Sensemaker in Residence" series. 

Naturalising Sense-making w/ Dave Snowden

September 3rd
September 10th
September 24th
October 1st

"Naturalising" in this context references the tradition of rooting philosophy in the natural sciences. In this series, each week Dave will look at "naturalising sense-making" from different scientific perspectives to develop an overall theory. Dave defines sense-making as "How do we make sense of the world so we can act in it”. Peter Jones of OCAD University in Toronto defined five schools of sensemaking in a 2015 article in Epic (see below). Snowden will explore aspects of this framing in terms of how do we gain a sufficiency of understanding to take action and will more specifically look at:

-Issues relating to epistemic justice in collective sensemaking
-The abductive turn in ethnographic research; looking for weak signals in dispositional systems
-Beyond crude manipulation of much behaviour economics to an elaborated vector theory of change
-Can we reverse Ashby’s Law? Dealing with asymmetric threat and opportunity through human sensor networks
-Making meaning problematic
