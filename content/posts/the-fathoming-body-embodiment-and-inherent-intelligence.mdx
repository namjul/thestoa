The act of embodiment as our capacity to sense, feel and actually inhabit our own bodies doesn’t just help us track thoughts and emotions with a non-grasping attitude so we can make space for new perspectives; it also allows within us an access point to life’s mysterious inherent intelligence... or Source... or God... 

“Within the fathoming body is found all of the teachings, is found suffering, the cause of suffering, and the end of suffering.” - Buddha
