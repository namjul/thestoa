This talk is based on Chuck's forthcoming book "How to be a Stoic When You Don't Know How". The focus of the talk is not on theory but on how to apply Stoic concepts to our daily lives to achieve the good life. Chuck will be presenting the fundamental concepts of Stoicism with specific mental exercises designed to reinforce these concepts.

Toronto is the home to the largest Stoic community in the world. On September 8, 2019, Stoicism Toronto hosted Stoicon-X Toronto, a conference on Stoic practice. The Modern Stoic movement has found itself and is now in the process of discovering and developing ways to practice both individually and collectively. Speakers included Massimo Pigliucci, Donald Robertson, Chuck Chakrapani, and John Vervaeke.
