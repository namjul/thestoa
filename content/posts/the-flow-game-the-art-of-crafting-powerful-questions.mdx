The Flow Game is a process designed as a board game that creates a space for individual and collective consciousness and intelligence to emerge through reflection, dialogue and interactive learning. 

The purpose and intent of the Flow Game is to strengthen and bring focus and flow into an important question in one's life; be it a project, a future direction of your work or relationships, or anything that is part of your personal growth.

In this session, you will get a chance to know Toke, one of the creators of the Flow Game, be inspired by its story, and actually come up with a question of your own, a question that reflects what your learning intention as a human being is at this moment of your life.

The Stoa will be playing the Flow Game next week ...
