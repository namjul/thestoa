Jeremy joins the Stoa to talk about the newly launched digital magazine, Liminal News, co-founded with Daniel Pinchbeck. He will explore the concept of liminality as the quintessential “structure of feeling” underlying our transitional times, how his background with Jean Gebser and integral philosophy inspires the editorial direction of Liminal News, and why “staying with the trouble” (Haraway) in such zones might yield collective insight for navigating our planetary crisis.
