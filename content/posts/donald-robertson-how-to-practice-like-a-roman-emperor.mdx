In this talk, Donald will be describing several key Stoic practices and psychological techniques found in The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius and other ancient sources.  Heâ€™ll be comparing these to strategies found in modern evidence-based psychological approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

The Modern Stoic movement has found itself and is now in the process of discovering and developing ways to practice both individually and collectively.
