Ludic (adj) - playful, spontaneous, non-goal oriented activity; related to games of chance

Liberation (n) - the action of setting someone free from bondage, oppression, slavery; release from limiting thoughts or behaviors
 
Ludic Liberation is a practice of personal and collective play aimed at revealing & releasing our internalized limitations. It can be practiced in groups, under the guidance of a game maker/observer, or on your own. 

“Pegging” is one way to practice Ludic Liberation. A PEG (Personal Existential Game) is a set of goals and constraints that you consent to play by in order to discover your own secret rules and experiment with new existential gameplay strategies.
