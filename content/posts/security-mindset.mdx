Jeffrey Ladish visits The Stoa to discuss the importance of the “security mindset.”

“Securing your digital life is a pain in the ass. It can be tedious, but it doesn’t have to be hard. It can be made a lot easier with clear instruction and clear protocols. As security researcher and engineer, I’ve gotten a lot of questions from my friends about how they can secure their laptops, phones, and accounts. Eventually, I decided I should write up some guides to personal security, so that my help could scale.”
