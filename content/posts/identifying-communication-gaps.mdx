Alexandra Tataryn visits The Stoa to identify communication gaps through a 1st to 5th person relating model.

Once you've mastered/understand each of these modes of relating, their values, and limitations, you can consciously bring people together for a form of collective inquiry with the intention of "downloading" what any single person could not personally articulate.

This model is based on the work of Suzanne Cook Greutor, EBIQ Integral, Circling practices, and Esoteric Meditation Practices.
