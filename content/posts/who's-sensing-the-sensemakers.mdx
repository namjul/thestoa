"There is a sensemaking crisis within sensemaking, with no room for criticism and reflexivity. There is too much tolerance on one hand, and too much contrarianism on the other, without any real literacy of critique and politics. While Socrates was executed for being a gadfly and trying to teach, today we see his legacy fetishized in practice, entry level philosophy, and conversational games. Meanwhile, the frame of philosophy of "Western civilization" and reason itself are crumbling, revealing a more complex social reality. In the attentional economy, we deprive people by ignoring, censoring, and demonizing through ingroup/ outgroup dynamics, sacrificing truth on the altar of egos. It's time hold up a mirror and stress test the leading sensemakers, so the chorus of protesting voices can be heard." - Brent Cooper
