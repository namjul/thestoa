In this mini-practice-series you'll have the opportunity to try out several different social meditation techniques, each facilitated by a Buddhist Geeks Teacher.  These social meditation methods are inspired by practices from the Buddhist wisdom tradition, but are done in such a way that makes them interpersonal in nature, as opposed to being purely introspective.  All participants will have the option to either practice aloud, or as a silent observer–what we call the Witness–so even if you aren't keen to practice aloud, and would like to observe the practices, you're very welcome to attend!

May 11th : Vince Horn: Zen Noting
May 18th : Kuan Luo: May It Arise
May 25th : Francis Lacoste: Essence Noting
