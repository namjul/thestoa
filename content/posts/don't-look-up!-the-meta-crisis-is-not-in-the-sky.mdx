The Netflix Film, Don't Look Up, is a comedy about a 'planet killer' comet spotted hurtling towards earth over a six month period and humanity's failure to deal with it despite having the knowledge and technology to do it. While the story can - and perhaps should - be viewed in many ways, it is widely considered to be about our failure to contend with ecological collapse due to climate change, despite knowing about the problem and roughly what needs to be done about it, for many decades. 

Those who dislike the film tend to find it shrill, exaggerated, unfunny, or think it is based on a bad analogy, or that it fails to offer a way out. But those who like the film tend to find it a uncannily close to life as we know it, a great metaphor that offers a refreshingly entertaining take on the nature of our predicament, and a timely challenge to reflect on the power dynamics, human waywardness and societal ruderlessness that arguably make mere 'calls to action' absurd. 

Perspectiva and The Stoa would like to give the film closer attention and to discuss it with our communities, starting with the suggestion that the movie is prismatic of what has been called our 'meta-crisis' -  a term with many framinings and definitions, but all concerned with the underlying dynamics within, behind, between and beyond surface phenomena. Indeed, it may be that the film is impressive precisely because it sets the agenda in style and substance for how to grasp the meta-crisis.

To make the most of this event, we request that everyone attending should watch Don't Look Up. We also strongly encourage everyone attending to either read Tasting the Pickle: Ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation or watch Jonathan Rowson's talk at The Stoa about it.
