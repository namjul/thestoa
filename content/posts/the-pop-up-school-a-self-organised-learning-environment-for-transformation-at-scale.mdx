Bonnitta Roy returns to The Stoa to discuss her new POP-UP School, a digital “SOLE” (self-organizing learning environment).

“[This] is a space for serious students and practitioners who see their participation not only as value they consume, but also as value they generate. It is a chance to experiment in the future of education and learn by doing. It is a community where people can help each other master skills and build confidence so that you can choose the actions you know in your heart are the right ones for you to do.”
