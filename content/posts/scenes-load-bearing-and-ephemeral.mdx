I asked Sarah Perry: So what do you want to do at The Stoa.

She responded: “Something about looking at scenes and hobbies as central social phenomena and trying to figure out how they work and what they do - maybe with specific references to video game speedrunning and textile production since I will definitely talk about those.”

How can a Sarah Perry fanboy say no to that?
