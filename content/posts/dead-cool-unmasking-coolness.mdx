 Unmasking Coolness

Fri May 21 2021

May 21st, 2021

Alex Ebert, singer-songwriter-philosopher, visits The Stoa to discuss the phenomena of cool. Alex demystifies the “rules of cool,” and discusses how coolness weaponized our status and colonized our dissent.

From Alex: “At 14:53, in my sleeplessness I misrepresented the estimated % of American evangelicals who had become socialist by 1925 as 85%.  The actual estimate is 25%.  Apologies."
