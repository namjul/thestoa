Samo Burja is a research fellow at The Long Now and the founder of Bismark Analysis. His research focuses on the longevity of institutions, intellectual dark matter, and Great Founder Theory. He is returning to The Stoa for a recurring session to address an important question. What does it take to be a live player in a dying game?
