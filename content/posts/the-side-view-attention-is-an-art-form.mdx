The Side View (TSV) shares with The Stoa two important beliefs. The first is that philosophy is a way of life, a practice (askēsis) of transformation rooted in new modes of perception, action, and virtue. The second is that philosophy, at least some of the time, should be pursued in public. In this series, Adam Robbert will bring TSV to The Stoa and explore the nature of philosophical practice inside and outside of the academy, the peril and promise of doing philosophy in the wild, and the relation between askēsis and the deliverances of philosophy. On this view, it is through exercise—both conceptual and nonconceptual, theoretical and practical—that philosophical illumination is achieved.
