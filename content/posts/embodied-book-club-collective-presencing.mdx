 Collective Presencing

Sat Oct 03 2020

October 3rd, 2020

As much as anything else, this book is an invitation to live consciously with and in evolution itself. To do this, we are forced to embrace more of who we are, where we came from and what we can be, both individually and collectively. Therefore we need new practices, new organizing patterns, new competencies, new language, and so on. In general, we need to discover, activate and embody a new human, collective capacity

October 3rd to November 7th @ 12:00 PM ET.
