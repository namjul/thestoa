What characterizes spirituality in metamodernity? Brendan will attempt an overview of the topic, offering a brief account of the historical epistemes (i.e., cultural codes, metamemes) and some analysis of their respective sensibilities and metanarratives to help contextualize the dialectical emergence of metamodernism. With this context we can begin to understand better the unique form religion and spirituality are taking in metamodernity, as well as how they might be leveraged in response to the "meta-crisis."
