Neural Annealing (Johnson, 2019) is a paradigm of neurocomputation that seeks to explain how excited states of consciousness are used to compress complex information into simple, compact representations. With an analogy to metallurgy, we could say that heating the nervous system and letting it cool slowly can bring about highly ordered states of mind.’

Andrés is the co-founder and co-director of research at the Qualia Research Institute (QRI). His work focuses on identifying the neurological and phenomenological signatures of pleasure and pain. He also does work in philosophy of mind, Effective Altruism, and participates in the development of neurotechnology aimed towards reducing suffering. He blogs at https://qualiacomputing.com/

QRI has the goal of identifying highly leveraged interventions to prevent intense suffering, techniques to increase the hedonic baselines, and methods to experience new heights of bliss in a reliable and sustainable way. See: https://www.qualiaresearchinstitute.org/
