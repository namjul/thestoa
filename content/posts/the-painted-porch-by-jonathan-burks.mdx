Jonathan Burks is an amazing artist and a regular at The Stoa. He created this song for The Stoa's one-year anniversary party. 

The song was the "knife's edge" version. The final version of the song can be downloaded here: https://jonburks.com/track/the-painted-porch

"pop a squat, gather near
while we dialogue and cohere
around the flame of what's alive
on the edge of the knife
I caught the signal and I double clicked
opened up on a Chapel Perilous
nothing stands forever man
it's always now or never

a mighty ship, a stormy sea
den of saints, hot dorks, and thieves
strange times call for strange moves
a dance floor of wow and woo
claimed and held to take the realm
with ol’ Stew at the helm
deep code dialogos 
afloat on a sea of thumos

it's not a place, it's not a thing
making sense don't need a scene
dialectic prayers carved in sand
shifting bits, emergent canvas
I needed a light, I found a torch
gathered up on the painted porch
it's always now or never
don't nothing last forever"
