“Life Art
Sees life itself as the primary medium.
Embraces an actual life situation as the frame for the work.
Uses tools, materials, stories, and dilemmas that exist in that frame of experience.
Rewards the practitioner with the opportunity to live inside the work.
Is tactile, sensual, embodied, and rooted in physical reality.
Seeks to be beautiful, healing, and generative.
Evolves the world of the maker.”
