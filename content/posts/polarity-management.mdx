Barry Johnson visits The Stoa to discuss Polarity Management.

"Some complex problems simply do not have "solutions". The key to being an effective leader is being able to recognize and manage such problems. Polarity Management presents a unique model and set of principles that will challenge you to look at situations in new ways. Also, included are exercises to strenghten your skills, and case studies to help you begin applying the model to your own unsolvable problems. Polarity Management will increase your ability to distinguish between problems that can be solved and polarities that cannot be solved, and show you how to effectively manage unsolvable problems."
