All (but one) crime could be officially punished via fines, and long-term voucher-client contracts could specify (and pay for) additional punishments (including fines, jail, torture, or exile), limits on freedoms like travel bans, curfews, call monitoring, and ankle-bracelets, and co-liability wherein a team agrees to all be punished if any one of them is found guilty. Bounty hunters could investigate and prosecute cases.
