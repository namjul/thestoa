This is a part of The Stoa's "Sensemaker in Residence" series. 

"We're seeing a surge in networked tribalization.  It's radically changed our society and if it isn't brought under control, our future is at risk.  Let's dig into this. From the origins of networked tribalization: some McLuhan, parallels to the printing press, failure of the old system (liberal order and its institutions).  How networked tribalization works today.  How tribes fight.  How they form.  How they grow.  Where networked tribalization is taking us.  The fight over the future of social AIs.  Tribal totalitarianism and the long night."
