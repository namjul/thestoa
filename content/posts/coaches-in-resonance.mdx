February 1st, 2021

Coaches in Resonance is a new experimental offering at The Stoa. Three active facilitators at The Stoa will be offering their gifts, in one-on-one sessions.

These coaching sessions will be based on the spirit of the gift economy. After your session, you can provide the coach with a monetary gift via PayPal. If this practice were situated in the market economy, the rates would fall in the $100-200 range. The coaches are happy to accept gifts falling out of either side of this range.

This will be a one month experiment, for the month of February. Each session is one hour. You can book Peter, A.J., and Tyson @ https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches
