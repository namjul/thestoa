In this talk John argues that the spiritual exercise of the view from above addresses a central problem faced by those cultivating a stoic way of  life, viz., how to bring about the  transformational experiences and aspirational development  so necessary to realizing a rational way of life even though such transformative experiences and aspirational changes of identity cannot be driven in an inferential manner. The talk explores the cognitive machinery involved in the exercise and explain how the exercise activates that machinery in the service of the transformation of perspectival and participatory knowing and thereby deepens understanding, overcomes absurdity, and provokes sensibility transcendence.

This talk is followed-up by a "view from above" exercise by Donald Robertson.
