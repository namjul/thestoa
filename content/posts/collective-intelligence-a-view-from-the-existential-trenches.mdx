We discovered a sense of Collective Intelligence as an unexpected by-product of leading Circling and Surrendered Leadership over the years. It's been magical experiencing it at work once a group has tipped into a strong coherence.

Inspiration:

- Life itself is self-organising towards greater flourishing.
- High degrees of agency and communion support the phenomena of Collective Intelligence. 
- How will intelligence manifest when we're present, willing and connected?
- Walking the line between collective intelligence already being present and the reality that we can gather as a group and apply collective intelligence towards something. 
- Is there a better way we can organise ourselves as Humans which Collective Intelligence is a key to? 
- The intention to embody a wider range of polarities allows for the greatest potential within a group and helps us expand as individuals.
