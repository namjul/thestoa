Our Anatomy Project aims to nurture an ongoing conversation between conceptual anatomical maps and the mystery of real bodies within the cultural and ecological systems that we inhabit. Vulvantine’s Day is a celebration of a possible world where embodied pleasure guides our relationships in life-giving systems.

There are codes embedded in the shapes our bodies take. What can we learn from the intricate map of the vulva- this threshold for human life that so wildly morphs through states of rest, pleasure, and birth?

Join us as we relax into the stream of eros and allow its currents to take us for a ride. Your tender-hearted, pleasure-seeking, still hunting animal self is invited into the conversation as we chart the innercourse of bodymind while exploring the lived terrain of eros, where love and power merge. Create a space to move around a bit and bring a vessel with water in it.
