Stealing the Culture with Dialogos (STCWD) is a series at The Stoa that will consist of conversational combinations we have never seen before.

In this first session, the prompt will be around the "collective shadow." We will watch Lubomir Arsov's In-Shadow: A Modern Odyssey (https://youtu.be/j800SVeiS5I), followed by a dialogos session with Lubomir, Uberboyo, Chris Gabriel (MemeAnalysis), and Arran Rogerson.
