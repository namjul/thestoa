May 5th, 2021

Something new is afoot. In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows.

In this session Ashley and Jason will tell the story of the birth of Doomer Optimism on Twitter, and ask the participants of the session to co-create the definition and examples of what Doomer Optimism might come to represent. The goal of this session is to set the stage, define terms and expectations, and begin the formation of a big tent community.

This session will be the first part of a Doomer Optimist Series hosted by Ashley and Jason. The series will start by interviewing some public intellectuals, asking them to bring their perspective to bear on Doomer Optimism. The series will then hold several panels of doomer optimists, making some space to ask questions, solve problems, and make plans. We don't know what we will find or create with the Doomer Optimist series, but the only way out is through. Join us!
