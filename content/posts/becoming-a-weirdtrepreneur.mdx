Joe Edelman returns to The Stoa to discuss his idea of "weird-treprenuers."

"The opposite of a same-preneur is a weird-trepreneur. Instead of funnels and transactions, the weird-trepreneur builds playgrounds and open-ended explorations in which each person does their own thing and comes out weirder on the other side, and where their interactions are unpredictable and lasting, rather than "transactional".

The key thing to realize is that explorations and playgrounds are what we were looking for the whole time. They bring us home, rather than leaving us in an isolated consumer rat-race of false promises. They spread agency, rather than streamlining it away. They let us be ourselves rather than a consumer and rule-follower.

Same-preneurship is the root of waste and depression in our society. And weird-trepreneurs will create new kinds of communities, venues, and organizations that will stop that waste and bring us alive again."
