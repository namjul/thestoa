Monasteries and modern monastic institutions are known for having fairly rigid structures: each part of the day is intended for a particular activity, and doing the activity fully is an important aspect of the training. Often, when a newcomer joins an institution like the Willow Monastic Academy, this presents a significant change to their regular way of life, and is an unexpected challenge to how they show up in the training.

We may expect it to be difficult to sit on the cushion and meditate for two hours a day, but it turns out the difficult thing is actually to be on time for activities, to wash our dishes well, and to exercise every day. The ways in which we habitually fall out of the structure are mirrors to our ingrained habit-patterns, and can be seeds for significant self-exploration.

In this talk, Sei will talk about why a shared structure can be an incredibly beneficial tool for human maturation, how this shows up at Willow, and how we may be able to bring this into our lives even without becoming full-time monastics
