 History, Ecology, and Potential

Thu Apr 22 2021

April 22nd, 2021

Taylor Barratt from Authentic Relating Toronto (www.circling.ca) visits The Stoa to discuss the intersubjective practice of Circling. A generally accepted history of the scene will be presented, along with how the scene and practice have evolved, and its potential role in the meta-crisis, meaning crisis, and culture wars.

Sign up for "Circling: Practice Session W/ Taylor Barratt" @ The Stoa on May 3rd @ 6:00 PM ET via The Stoa's Patreon: patreon.com/the_stoa
