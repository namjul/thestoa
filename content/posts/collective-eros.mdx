How do you know what you like? How do you know which ideas to follow? What is that magic that strengthens group coherence?

There is a curious, excitable, pulsating presence that flows beneath the swift currents of our rational minds. This is an invitation to reveal, and to feel, these messages from below. We will engage our senses and play from the somatic terrain of the body to amplify our more subtle ways of knowing. Join us to experiment with the space beyond words that brings aliveness to the interpersonal space among, and between, us.

Jote Lamar is an artist and community builder who is continually inspired by the process of deepening in relationship. Lara Catone is a writer, educator, leadership coach and scholar-practitioner focusing on transforming dynamics of gender and sexuality to harness relational power. Together they founded Our Anatomy Project with the mission to engage art and story as educational praxis that brings the anatomy of arousal and pleasure to life.
