“The main idea is that we train our sensemaking capacity to cope with a wide range of contexts appearing to us as situationally complex. We may have skin in the game (deep dasein leads us to places for action or outcome) but in complex situations there’s no game to win. We can’t change inharmonious systems as whole systems, we have to cope in the Pluriverse, or the multiple participants encountered in the disclosed space that emerges. Disclosing is a collaborative design, a creative strategy of structuring small interventions in collaborative contexts, that lead to a next stable state. Sensemaking isn’t about figuring out and  leading, its exploratory and incremental.” - Peter Jones
