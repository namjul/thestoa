Even twenty years into the early 21st century we remain unable to agree on how to solve the multiple big and complex problems facing the world, still thinking reality is just a matter of opinion until it hits too close and personal. Why is that? And lacking agreement what can any one person do to drive a change of course beyond riding along to the sound of inevitability? In this presentation I describe the construct of the problem, a way to design a post-consumerist philosophy specifically with emergent movements in mind, and the method of nurturing that emergence into a self-sustaining movement that prepares the ground for change.
