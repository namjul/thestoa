This session will involve a brief discussion of Stoic philosophy and Stoicism's views on self-improvement, followed by a practice exercise. Together we will walk through the Stoic 'contemplation of a sage' practice, used as a way to improve our moral imagination and our view of the possible ways to act well in difficult situations. All levels of experience with Stoicism are welcome.
