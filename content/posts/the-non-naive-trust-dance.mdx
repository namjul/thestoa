“Improving at non-naive trust dancing means being able to honor and respect the distrust that exists in others and in yourself, so that you’re not fighting it as you creatively work together to find a mutually satisfying resolution to whatever arises.”

Questions from Malcolm:

- How do you build non-naïve trust, between people or within yourself?
- How can experiences of distrust (or betrayals of trust) be turned into a generative resource, rather than a roadblock?
- How do you actually “trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too”? (from Kipling’s poem “If—“)
- How can people or groups that are operating in cultures based on the emerging new post-judgmental, collaborative, Game B platform mutually recognize that they are doing so?
- To the extent that a given person or group is confused about some aspect of collaborative culture, how can they realize & integrate such a confusion, in dialogue with other people?
- How can people learn to operate in collaborative (non-coercive) ways?
- How can a high-trust group of people honor ways in which people (inside or outside of the group) are not yet able to trust them?
