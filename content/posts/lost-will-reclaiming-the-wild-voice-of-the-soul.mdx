The will is the deepest expression of who we are and what we want: an unstoppable force that is unfettered by mental or societal limitation. It is also one of the first things that we learn to silence in childhood, in order to ‘get along’ or to make things easier for the people around us. Is the will truly something to fear? Is it something that would unleash an unstoppable force of selfishness on the world? Or is it something deeper, connected to the wildness both inside ourselves and in nature, that is an expression of something vast, untamed, and beautiful. In re-connecting to the voice of our will, we reconnect to the voice of nature as it moves through us and into the world.
