Hell is a comfy armchair the philosopher can never leave. Isn't it better to be torn away from the endless, self-created divertissements of mental cock-wobbling, and be hurled headlong and screaming into the shit, piss, and vomit of the (utterly non-academic) spontaneity of existence?

Hell is a place where nothing ever happens because we never get around to doing what needs to be done. (It takes more than tidying your room.) The mind is a place of never-ending procrastination. Paradoxically, or symmetrically, the perennial diddling, doodling, & eventual doddering of the mind’s masturbatory theories about itself are what create and sustain Hell­, for everyone.

This event, God willing, is an opportunity to be liberated from endless deliberation and to be tossed unceremoniously into the farts and belches of bodily experience. When it comes to Hell, better out than in! It is only through intense discomfiture, and a terrifying loss of facemask for the sophist in stoic's clothing, that freedom lies.
