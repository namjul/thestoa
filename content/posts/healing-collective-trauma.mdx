Thomas Hübl will be visiting The Stoa to have a launch party for his new book: Healing Collective Trauma: A Process for Integrating Our Intergenerational and Cultural Wounds.
"Spiritual teacher Thomas Hübl has spent years investigating why it is that old and seemingly disconnected traumas can seed their way through communities and across generations. His work culminates in Healing Collective Trauma, a new perspective on trauma that addresses both its visible effects and its most hidden roots. Thomas combines deep knowledge of mystical traditions with the latest scientific research."
