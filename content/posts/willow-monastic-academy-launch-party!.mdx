Willow is the new Canadian branch of The Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth, and we have just opened our doors! As a modern monastic training center, we use an ecology of practices rooted in the wisdom of ancient Buddhism combined with modern transformational modalities to fit our current times, where wise and loving leadership is desperately needed. In this session, Seishin will talk about the practices we engage with, and what the road towards opening a modern Buddhist center has been like.

Come celebrate with us!
