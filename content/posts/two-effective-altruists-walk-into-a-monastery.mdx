From ecological devastation to starvation to the pollution of the epistemic commons, our world is full of pressing problems. Virabhadra and Yuli Jadov are two people who set themselves in search of ways to address them. After meeting as members of Toronto's Effective Altruism community they entered the residential training program at Willow Monastic Academy for the majority of 2020. In 2021, Yuli returned to take up a community-building post with Effective Altruism Toronto. Virabhadra set off to deepen his training in Vermont at MAPLE, the Monastic Academy for the Preservation of Life on Earth, returning now to grow Willow Monastic Academy, the Canadian location

In this dialectic and Stoa community inquiry, the two friends will share what each sees at the intersection of the two approaches to making the world a better place and explore their focal alignment, divergence, and synthesis, with a meditation thrown in for integrity.
