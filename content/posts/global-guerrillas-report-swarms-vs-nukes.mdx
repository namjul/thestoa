John Robb visits The Stoa to discuss his latest Global Guerrillas Report on swarms vs nukes.

"The global, open-source movement, composed of nations, corporations, and individuals, has assembled in just a few days to oppose Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. It is now conducting swarming attacks on the country with the most nuclear weapons in the world. The rules of nuclear peace that kept us safe for eighty years are in tatters."
