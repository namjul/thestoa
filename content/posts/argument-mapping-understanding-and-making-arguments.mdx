Nate Otey from ThinkerAnalytix visits The Stoa to discuss argument mapping.

"Argument mapping is a visual method of displaying how reasons work to support a claim. A map exposes the hidden structure of the argument so that everyone can see how all the reasons fit together. You can map objections to any premise, so you can see exactly where two people disagree. The process of mapping also exposes hidden assumptions (a.k.a. implicit co-premises), which are often the true source of disagreement. (You know when it feels like people are just talking past each other?)”
