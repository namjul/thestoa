How can we relate to money, sex, power and alphadom with wisdom in the emerging world? Join Duncan Horst, student of tantra turned Wall Street financier and artist collective impresario for an exploration of this inquiry.

This is the second session of a new ongoing series at The Stoa called "Sensing the New Myth" and hosted by Tyson Wagner. Together, we are exploring art, storytelling, music and myth in the emergent landscape and discussing how we, as a community can be stewards of a beautiful culture.
