Puru the Guru visits The Stoa to discuss his notion of “the implementation gap.”

“Despite high intelligence, large amounts of information, we are unable to achieve states of good health, happiness, mastery of skills or preferred outcomes from interactions with others such as for negotiations or teaching. Why? Because we are not engaging with and closing the Implementation Gap!”
