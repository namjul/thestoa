Laurence Currie-Clark is the inventor of a sensemaking game called The Glass Bead Game.

"The Glass Bead Game is a way of playing with the ideas of human culture; it uses them like a painter paints with the colors on the palette. The insights of the worldâ€™s great scholars and artists have been reduced to core topics, with which the Glass Bead Game player plays. It is up to us to design and perfect the game. Theoretically this game can contain the entire knowledge of the universe."

Laurence will visit The Stoa and guide us through playing this fine game.
