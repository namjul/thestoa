Corey is an ordained Zen monk who lives on an island north of Seattle with his wife and three daughters. He writes the Zen Embodiment blog, teaches qigong and other energetic practices online, offers workshops & intensives focused on energetic internal process, and leads a growing international online group of practitioners called The Energy Collective. After spending his twenties in a Japanese monastery falling in love with internal energetic embodiment work, and then fifteen years learning to integrate those experiences, he has unique creative insights to help guide others in this process.

Corey is available for individual online private qigong sessions, internal process discussion, and distance healing sessions.
