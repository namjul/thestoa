 A Discussion

Sat Dec 05 2020

December 5th, 2020

Vince Horn returns to The Stoa to discuss the "neta-sangha" concept with Peter Limberg, and if The Stoa is an example of a meta-sangha.

"A meta-sangha is a new type of community that stands apart from (i.e. meta to) standard sanghas, but is simultaneously inclusive of them and supports their development." Source: https://medium.com/@buddhistgeeks/meta-sanghas-b0104b013fe2
