Stoic Provocations is a new series that affords us the opportunity to practice our Stoicism. A speaker visits us, shares some edgy thoughts that put us at the edge of our thinking. We possibly get triggered, stop the recording and get into a collective dialogue, with a little twist ...

Brent Cooper returns to the Stoa to provoke more officially in this SP about "anti-intellectualism", building on his previous critique of the sensemaking crisis perpetuated by the thought leaders themselves. A term documented by historian Richard Hofstadter in the 1960s, anti-intellectualism has returned with a vengeance in the 21st century. It refers to a general or specific distrust of experts, academics, and ideas, and can be found in laymen and intellectuals alike. From Trumpism to the Intellectual Dark Web, Rebel Wisdom to the Stoa itself, anti-intellectualism is a latent curse against our better collective judgement and community building. It is reason used as a weapon against reason. Understanding it as a long term trend as well as a present homegrown crisis is key to undoing its damage. The responsibility of intellectuals to "speak truth and expose lies" (Chomsky) is inherently risky and alienating, but avoiding or denying it is to be complicit in systemic evil.
