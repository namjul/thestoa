Derrick Jensen visits The Stoa for a conversation with Peter Limberg, followed by a Q&A.

"Derrick Jensen (born December 19, 1960) is an American author, ecophilosopher, radical environmentalist, and anti-civilization advocate. According to Democracy Now!, Jensen "has been called the poet-philosopher of the ecological movement." more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jensen

The title of this talk comes from this quote: “at some point in his career, everybody who loves Derrick Jensen's work is going to hate him, because he refuses to follow any ideological lines, and takes his thoughts wherever they go.”
