Background:

Systemic Constellations is a powerful tool for navigating complexity and helping teams move through intense dynamics with greater ease, efficiency and alignment.

The practice of Systemic Constellations allows us to visualize the patterns of interaction and interdependent relationships of a system. By making these dynamics visible, we widen our understanding and obtain a greater variety of choices in how we respond. By revealing what often goes unsaid or challenges that may lie hidden, Systemic Constellations can support leadership to identify leverage points for greater collaboration, as well as create and maintain greater coherence within complex systems.
