Philosophy Matthew Sharp visits The Stoa to present his paper on Stoic virtue ethics:

http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30059463/sharpe-stoicvirtue-2013.pdf

"The famous Stoic claim that virtue is the only good marks it off in one way as the definitive ancient "virtue ethics." Stoic virtue ethics, like Aristotle's, places a premium on the cultivation of the character or ethos of agents, as an ethical pursuit in the light of which questions concerning the rightness of actions are then framed."
