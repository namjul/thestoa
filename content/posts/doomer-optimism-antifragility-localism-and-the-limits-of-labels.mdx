The Doomer Optimism series at The Stoa continues!

In this session hosts Ashley Colby and Jason Snyder welcome Joe Norman. Joe was present at our first conversation on Doomer Optimism hosted by Noetic Nomads (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdRohBH5_RE&t=1206s), and played an integral role in representing the localist perspective. We invite Joe to discuss the concept of doomer optimism and how it relates to Antifragility and Localism. Ashley, Jason and Joe are all pursuing some form of antifragility through localism, and in this discussion we hope to address some of the challenges and successes in navigating the crisis and complexity of the world via a focus on home, land, and production. Join us!
