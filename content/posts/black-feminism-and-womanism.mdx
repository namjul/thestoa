Full event title: Black Feminism and Womanism: Soulful Critique in a Pivotal Time

This discussion among scholar-activists Loretta Ross, Imani Perry, and Toni M. Bond will explore the intersection of moral, spiritual, and aesthetic issues centering on and around liberatory feminism and womanist ethics.

The conversation will likely touch upon: call-out culture, reproductive justice, intersectionality, art and spirituality in liberation, Critical Race Theory, youth and higher education amid Covid, and other related topics in this improvisational dialogue.
