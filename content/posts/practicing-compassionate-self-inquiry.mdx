Susan will guide the group in a self-compassion exercise that she does with all of her counseling clients. The practice is designed to help you develop spacious presence as your default mode. Then, she will engage in dialog with group members to help you integrate this practice into your personal life or your coaching/counseling work with others. This practice is described in Susanâ€™s latest book, From Triggered to Tranquil: How Self-Compassion and Mindful Presence Can Transform Relationship Conflicts and Heal Childhood Wounds.
