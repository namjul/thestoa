Harry Bergeron visits The Stoa to discuss the looming need for an anti-social credit system.

“It’s time to get to work. Western Civilization is collapsing, we’re entering a sci-fi dystopia of unimaginable horror, and the wicked are praised while the decent are persecuted. Be grateful you live in such momentous times where your contributions become all the more meaningful. You don’t choose the age you’re born into, you conduct yourself to the best of your abilities so you can hold your head high when it’s time to depart it. Unreasonable challenges aren’t some superfluous burden; they’re baked into the terms of existence. Transmuting shit into gold and pain into splendor is what human beings do.”
