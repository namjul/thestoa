Alanja Forsberg, founder of Avalon and lead facilitator of Surrendered Unity Leadership Training, returns to The Stoa to discuss the virtue of surrender.
 
"Alanja's vision is to spread a new leadership paradigm where, in Integral terminology, people gather to co-create from a transpersonal level of consciousness. Her passion is empowering individuals to realize their full potential in the world, for which she has developed powerfully effective practices to release trauma, shadows, and trapped life-energy in the body-mind-spirit. She is committed to radical honesty and unleashing the potential all humans have once they have experienced themselves as whole."
