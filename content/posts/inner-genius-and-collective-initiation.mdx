"We can find our way to a collective awakening and societal renewal, but only if a transformation occurs that awakens the soul of humanity."

Join renowned author, mythologist and storyteller Michael Meade for a discussion around personal genius, paths of initiation and collective rites of passage in times of upheaval.

This is the third session of a new ongoing series at The Stoa called "Sensing the New Myth" hosted by Tyson Wagner. Together, we are exploring art, storytelling, music and myth in the emergent landscape and discussing how we, as a community can be stewards of a beautiful culture.

You can learn more about Michael and participate in his new live series "Paths of Initiation" here: https://www.mosaicvoices.org/events
