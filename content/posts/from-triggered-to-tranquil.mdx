Susan will introduce her new book, From Triggered to Tranquil, which shows readers how to do “inner work” when they get emotionally upset, reactive, or shut down. She will describe the 5 steps of trigger work and then guide participants in some exercises from the book—exercises that teach you how to catch and calm trigger reactions so you can get back to being present and resourceful. Doing these exercises will help you heal your fear of emotional discomfort and allow you to handle situations you used to avoid.

 Here is an excerpt from the book: “Your trigger reactions can be the doorway to understanding and embodying a much bigger life process that I like to call whole-making. As I see it, life itself is about whole-making —integrating the various parts of a system into increasingly interrelated wholes. Our trigger reactions help us see aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of. As we explore these reactions, we discover parts of ourselves that have been denied, abandoned, or repressed. This is the realm of the human unconscious that psychologists call our shadow. As we enter through this portal, we encounter forgotten hurts and disappointments, unmet childhood needs, protective personality habits that we adopted to keep us safe, beliefs that help us make sense of things we don’t understand, and ideas about ourselves and others that feed the insecure ego’s need to be knowledgeable, good, or right. Discovering and learning to accept these lost parts helps us actualize more of our unique human potential. As we embrace and welcome these parts, we become more whole.”
