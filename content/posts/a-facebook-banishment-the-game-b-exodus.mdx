Jim Rutt visits The Stoa to discuss his recent Facebook banning.

A tweet from Jim: "I can confirm that all three admins of the GameB Group (including me) were bounced by Facebook at about the same time this morning. This sure seems to be a specific attack on #GameB. Y'all know I'm not much on conspiracy theories, but this doesn't look like a mistuned algo."

A follow-up: "So #GameB ready to RUMBLE?"
