Joshua Lengfelder, co-founder of the app Randonautica, visits The Stoa to discuss becoming a randonaut with Chris Gabriel from MemeAnalysis. 

What is Randonauting? “Randonauting is the act of using the Randonautica app to generate truly random locations sourced with quantum entropy. The user can then choose to venture to these locations to see what they find. They often discover that what they see lines up with their intention, which is what they were thinking about when they generated the point. But even if this doesn't happen, it's a way to mindfully explore the world around them.”
