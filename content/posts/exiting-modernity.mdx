James Ellis (Meta-Nomad) from the Hermitix podcast visits The Stoa to discuss his new book, Exiting Modernity.

“Since 2017, author James Ellis (under the pseudonym 'Meta-Nomad') has been sharing his perspectives on the modern world, collapse and Accelerationism. Here for the first time in print is the entirety of Ellis' writings. Topics such as the myth of progress, boredom, consumerism, exit, dropping out, asceticism, LARPing, freedom, education and more are explored, culminating in the overarching idea that perhaps modern life isn't that great after all. If you are someone who has acquired everything modernity promised would make you happy, and yet still feel actively unfulfilled and dissatisfied, then this book is for you.”
