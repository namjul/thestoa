December 28th, 2020

Full line-up: Jordan Hall, Nora Bateson, Greg Thomas, and Rich Bartlett, and Christopher Mastropietro.

Jordan Hall returns The Stoa for an inverse "Sensemaker in Residence" series. Jordan presents concepts, at the edge of his thinking, and then "we" begin to contemplate them more deeply.

Note: Jordan Hall was a no show today, but we had a great dialogos session regardless.
