Tada Hozumi visits The Stoa to discuss "Cultural Somatics."

"Cultural somatics, to me, has always been an emerging field of practice with an organic body of common knowledge and shared language – not a modality with a set approach that is tightly defined by a select group of teachers – that sees individual and collective change as an inseparable, interconnected, and embodied processes."
