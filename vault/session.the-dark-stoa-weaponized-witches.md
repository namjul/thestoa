The Dark Stoa returns for a special Halloween session.

Patrick Ryan, the most dangerous man on the internet, will be back for a one-off session to discuss how the history of Wicca was appropriated, and how witches actually exist, but not as you may think ...

Costumes: optional. Drinking: recommended. Keeping it clean in the chats: mandatory.
