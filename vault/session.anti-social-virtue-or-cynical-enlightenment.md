Justin Murphy visits the Stoa to discuss Anti-Social Virtue. “Many people do not know that a weird but direct line runs from Ancient Cynicism, to Stoicism, to Christ, to Deleuze. This is my line so I think I am well positioned to very briefly characterize it in generative way. If you’d like a catchy title you can call it whatever you want, but I might suggest: Anti-Social Virtue, or Cynical Enlightenment.” - Justin Murphy
