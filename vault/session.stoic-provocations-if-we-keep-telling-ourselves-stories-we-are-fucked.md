Stoic Provocations is a new series that affords us the opportunity to practice our Stoicism. A speaker visits us, shares some edgy thoughts that put us at the edge of our thinking. We possibly get triggered, stop the recording and get into a collective dialogue, with a little twist ...

Michael Smith joins The Stoa to draw attention to the sense of truth, the ways we preference stories over truth, and the fact that no amount of sensemaking can matter until we choose to prefer truth instead.
