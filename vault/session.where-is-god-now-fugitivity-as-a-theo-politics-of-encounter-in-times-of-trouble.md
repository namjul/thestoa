Bayo Akomolafe visits The Stoa to ask the question: Where is God Now? Followed by a Q&A.

"I thought we could discuss the weirdness of these times, the archetypal longings for answers as we face an unprecedented series of upheavals and challenges to settler epistemologies, and the promise in the figure of the fugitive." - Bayo Akomolafe
