The bridge is inspired by a feeling I have had for a long time, which was put nicely into words by David Chapman, here:
https://meaningness.com/metablog/stem-fluidity-bridge

One phrase in particular is resonant with the reason I’m trying this experiment called The Bridge: “Misperception of woo blocks the bridge beyond rationality”

A critically important point to understand, and one which has been new(s) to many people with whom I’ve shared it in Stoa-adjacent spaces, is that metacognition is very much NOT thinking about thinking; it is non-cognitive, in the sense we normally use the word cognition...utterly different in felt experiential character from thinking about ANYTHING, and most especially from thinking ABOUT THINKING.

In order to create the Bridge, we will explore a bit of the scientific and philosophical grounding for this assertion; since the vast majority of people who are ripe for a transition into meta-systematic/fluid mode ways of relating in the world received their systematic/rational training though the STEM disciplines, this grounding will help to overcome the knee-jerk reaction to woo which is endemic to such people.

This session will be an exploration of that territory.
