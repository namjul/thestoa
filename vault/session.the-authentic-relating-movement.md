Susan, Jason, and Sara will reflect on the past, present, and future of the Authentic Relating Movement. We’ll look at the original aims of the movement and evaluate what the movement does well and not so well. We’ll each take a turn on the hot seat and interview one another. And we’ll look together at emerging cultural trends and challenges that we may want to address as the movement continues to grow and evolve.
