Is it possible to affirm that our social reality is a kind of spell, an incantation produced by advertising and the media, and therefore that these disciplines are modern forms of magic?

These and other questions will be addressed in Eros Unchained, a documentary series that will make a historical journey on the influence of magic—and in particular Renaissance erotic magic—in advertising, public relations, and modern media. This exclusive 25-minute extended trailer touches upon the main topics and characters of the series and gives an overall view of its themes and characters.

You can also watch this extended trailer in Spanish at CVLTO’s YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/c/CVLTOTV
