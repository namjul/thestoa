Forrest Landry visits The Stoa to discuss the "Ephemeral Group Process.‚Äù The two goals of this process:

"1. to facilitate a process thoughtful communication and community intelligence in the service of mutually evident omni-considerate integrated design.

2. to provide an organization level framework for handling situations which require a systemically accurate and holistic response to an especially complex and dynamic problem."
