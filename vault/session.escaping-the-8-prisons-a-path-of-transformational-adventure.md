Clinton Callahan, originator of Possibility Management and author of Radiant Joy Brilliant Love, visits The Stoa to discuss the “8 prisons” for us to escape.

“In Westernized Modern Culture, we are born in a series of eight bubbles that are woven into the layers of our Boxes. Getting out of each of those bubbles happens through initiatory processes.

The first and foremost initiatory process is taking responsibility for being in those bubbles in the first place. It might seem shocking to you if you are reading this website that we assume that you are still in your mother’s belly or in your parents' bubble or in school even if you have left your parents’ home or school decades ago. Please read the symptoms of being in each of those bubbles with attention multiple times. The first time, your Box and Gremlin will probably deny, and attack by telling you that this does not apply to you or this book is stupid anyway.”
