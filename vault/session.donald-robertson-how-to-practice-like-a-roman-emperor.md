In this talk, Donald will be describing several key Stoic practices and psychological techniques found in The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius and other ancient sources.  Heâ€™ll be comparing these to strategies found in modern evidence-based psychological approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

Toronto is the home to the largest Stoic community in the world. On September 8, 2019, Stoicism Toronto hosted Stoicon-X Toronto, a conference on Stoic practice. The Modern Stoic movement has found itself and is now in the process of discovering and developing ways to practice both individually and collectively. Speakers included Massimo Pigliucci, Donald Robertson, Chuck Chakrapani, and John Vervaeke.
