Daniel M. Ingram visits The Stoa to discuss his book, Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha: An Unusually Hardcore Dharma Book.

"The very idea that Buddhist teachings can be mastered will arouse controversy within Buddhist circles. Even so, Daniel Ingram insists that enlightenment is an attainable goal, once our fanciful notions of it are stripped away, and we have learned to use meditation as a method for examining reality rather than an opportunity to wallow in self-absorbed mind-noise."
