Today ordinary folks are rarely sued, except re auto accidents; we require liability insurance there. If everyone had a “voucher” who insured all their legal liability, we could avoid many difficult collective judgments on privacy, freedom, cruelty, dignity, and sharing of responsibility. All (but one) crime could be officially punished via fines, and long-term voucher-client contracts could specify (and pay for) additional punishments (including fines, jail, torture, or exile), limits on freedoms like travel bans, curfews, call monitoring, and ankle-bracelets, and co-liability wherein a team agrees to all be punished if any one of them is found guilty. Bounty hunters could investigate and prosecute cases.
