Theodore Taptiklis visits The Stoa to discuss 5 Graces and the practice of Entangled Bodies.

"What’s come up instead— first with the pandemic, and now with Black Lives Matter and its excoriation of history — is a growing recognition that what matters most is how we are with each other. (And as well as with each other human, with each other entity on the planet we inhabit). So now we must turn from our seething beliefs and imaginings to face the most basic aspect of our lives: the practicalities of noticing and relating — of recognising the rich complexities of ordinary life, and then dealing with the entanglements of ourselves and other people in the onrush of our everyday encounters."
