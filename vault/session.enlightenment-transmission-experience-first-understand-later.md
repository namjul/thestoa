"This event is not an ordinary lecture about just any subject. It might not be obvious or expected, but it's about you. Not an imaginary you, but the actual real-time you.

I recommend you give more attention to the phenomenological experience of you, than to my lecture concepts.

I'll be communicating from within your inner world to your pre-language self, aiming to move your awareness beyond the restrictive filters of your socially-conditioned, traumatised and triggered identity.

I hope you get this liberating experience soon, before we collectively enter an era of unprecedented reality disorientation.

Whatever happens, more support exists than you can ever imagine. You are welcome to reach out to me to start a conversation with me.

To assure your place. Book early. Arrive early on Zoom."
