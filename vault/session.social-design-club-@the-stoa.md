July 1st, 2020

Every week we'll have an online event where someone presents a social design and gets feedback. We'll also have presentations from successful social designers, and debates about what kind of social designs will best serve society going forward.

The club is for those who design social systems: systems made of people, where there are codified and mutually understood roles and responsibilities. These design can range from dinner table conversation games to social networks and global governance structures.
