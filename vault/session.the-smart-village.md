Euvie Ivanova & Mike Gilliland from Future Thinkers visit The Stoa to discuss their new project: The Smart Village!

"Most conventional cities are unsustainable and miserable as living spaces – with the crime, noise, pollution, traffic, unaffordable tiny box apartments, the feeling of social isolation, and constant stress.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed or cancelled a lot of the aspects of cities that used to be attractive – the events, concerts, shops, and restaurants. And the riots have made some cities nearly unliveable.

Many people are seeking healthier alternatives.

WHAT ARE SMART VILLAGES?

Smart villages are a new, healthier way to live. They are rural settlements that integrate technology, nature, and community.

Smart Villages operate from the principles of nature, creating environments that support the health of the bioregion, the communities, and the people & other living beings within them.

WHAT MAKES US UNIQUE?

Future Thinkers Smart Village is a place that combines technological innovation, creativity, personal development, education, regenerative agriculture, and community – located in a beautiful mountain valley the heart of the Kootenays, BC, Canada."
