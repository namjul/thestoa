In the age of 4th generation warfare there is a pressing need for a design discipline geared towards creative ontology. Reality tunnel design is a competitive struggle. Memes are weaponized, and the autonomous movement of the non-living is threatening to swallow civilization. Today, belief is a technological problem. One which will be solved by talented curators, technomancers, and eventually by the autonomous superorganisms we're breeding in the internet.

The future is invading us at the speed of broadband, and we will need to understand how to cult(ivate) our own memetic fields to survive. Ontological design is the idea that by curating the human environment, human perception and human interactions we are in fact designing the lived reality of a human. The only one way to be “free” is to create, create, create. Design yourself.
