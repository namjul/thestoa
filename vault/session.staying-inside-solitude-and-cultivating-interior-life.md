 Solitude and Cultivating Interior Life

Solitude is both something thinkers recognize human beings need, and a challenge for those same human beings to understand, endure, and develop. It is even more pressing during the COVID-19 crisis. We will be looking at some key insights about solitude, about connections to others, the world, and oneself, and about developing a robust interior life coming from thinkers such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Epictetus, and Aristotle.
