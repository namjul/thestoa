Stephen Jenkinson is our philosopher in residence for the month of August. We will be discussing his new book: A Generation’s Worth: Spirit Work While the Crisis Reigns

“A Generation’s Worth started out as a bit of stenography, transcribing a quartet of livestream sessions. Those notes met the realities of covid 19, the lockdowns and upheavals, and turned into something of a plague document. The book’s entries are dated, and chronologically rendered, and read as dispatches from the front lines of a strange occupation undeclared. What does a life’s work mean in a time of undoing? A Generation’s Worth sets out to learn liveable answers. Dying and death, love and matrimony, money and soul, aging and elderhood, drawn through the eye of a pestilential needle: this is the spirit work, and that is the crisis.”
