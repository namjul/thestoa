Philosopher Peter Sjöstedt-H visits The Stoa to discuss the philosophy of power from his book Neo-Nihilism.

From Amazon: "This text concisely puts forward the case for a form of nihilism - fusing thoughts from Hume, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, amongst others. It forcefully argues that morality as we know it is a power structure disguised as knowledge; that law is based upon this false idol; and that thus power is, in fact, the basis of all life."

Peter will share his thoughts followed by a Q&A.
