Colombian writer and independent researcher Mauricio Loza will present his thesis on the origin of psychology, advertising and modern media, namely that they arise from erotic magic, an idea first proposed by Romanian historian of religion Ioan P. Culianu in his classic study Eros and Magic in the Renaissance. He will also present the official trailer of Eros Unchained, the upcoming documentary series co-written with Spanish documentary filmmaker Gabriel García Muñoz, which will be released in late 2021.
