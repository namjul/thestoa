 The Future of Love, Sex and Friendship

Session 1 (Love)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen ></iframe>

A four-part discussion about men, women, love, sex, desire, communication - or lack thereof. What does intimacy mean in the era of dating apps, lowest-ever marriage-rates, media-induced resentment between the sexes, and profound uncertainty about the future.

Do we need each other? Do we want each other? Should we get married? What is love in a pandemic?

Session 1: Love. What is love? Love is an ancient philosophical puzzle. From Plato onwards, love both permits access to knowledge and presents a distraction to it. This week will examine the multiple types of Greek love - philia, eros, pragma, storge, philautia, ludus, agape, xenia - and suggest that our age has become unduly dominated by one particular idea of love - a combination of eros and possessiveness, love as a commodity. Against this, the love of the philosophers, past and present - love of the city, love that opens people up to the cosmos, will be presented as a critique of our narrow image.
