This session is about being in the right relationship with your edge, living at your brink but not over it.

Ari is gonna describe the most delicious cycle in his life; his fear and his desires calling him towards adventure, his struggles stretching and building him, his experiences distilling compelling insights and his euphoric integration of those insights into his life. Rinse and repeat, around the world, in the most extreme sports and stunts you can imagine. Maybe get excited.
