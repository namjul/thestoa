Gerald, a philosophical practitioner and author of Doing Philosophy, visits The Stoa to discuss how we actually “do” philosophy.

“First published in 2012, Doing Philosophy presents the basics of how ‘to do’ philosophy — what philosophy is, how we can think, the nature of logic, some special terms — in a straightforward and easy to understand style. Then, using questions and exercises as well as everyday examples, the author takes the reader on a wide-ranging tour of key philosophical topics which, as well as the ‘standard fare’ of logic, epistemology, mind, God etc., also includes ethical, social, scientific, cultural and human issues such as time, cosmology, war, animal rights, euthanasia, abortion, genetics, evolution, and the meaning of life.”
