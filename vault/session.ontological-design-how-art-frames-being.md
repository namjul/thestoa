Daniel Fraga and Owen Cox return to The Stoa with another session of Ontological Design sessions. 

In the age of 4th generation warfare, memes are weaponized. Technocapitalism cephalises - it becomes a sentient and autonomous entity. It gains a will of its own, continually recycling human desire for its own survival and replication. And it is only accelerating. Ontological design is a way of facing up to this dire state of affairs. It is the idea that we can acknowledge our circumstances and make the best of them - perhaps going so far as designing our desires, our beliefs and our ontologies, the very vectors technocapitalism colonises us through.

In this session, Daniel Fraga and Owen Cox from Technosocial Podcast are joined by an illustrious panel composed by transhumanist philosopher queen Rachel Haywire, rabble-rousing rogue sensemaker Andrew Sweeny from Parallax Magazine and the internet's foremost memeticist, Chris Gabriel from Meme Analysis.

We will explore questions such as: what do spiritual and magical traditions have to teach us, who live in this weirdest of ages? What kind of subcultures can emerge in this panorama? How do we understand and engage with the ghosts, poltergeists and egregores of the world-wide web? In crafts like carpentry, it is said that there is a will, a wisdom inherent in the material itself - that the possibility for the finished product already exists, latent, in the wood. What is then latent in the prima materia of human attention? What is Art, in this context? And what kind of darkness must we face in order to stare it dead in the eye?

Join us for a trip to the underworld - if you can handle it.
