Igor Grossmann, director of the Wisdom and Culture Lab, visits The Stoa to discuss his labs work in demystifying wisdom.

"Demystifying wisdom: a “philosopher’s stone” in behavioral, cognitive and social sciences. Are there unique qualities distinguishing sound judgment beyond abstract intelligence and personality dimensions? Or is wisdom just a pipedream? To address this question, we aim to uncover misconceptions about wisdom and identify psychological processes that enable people to reason wisely."
