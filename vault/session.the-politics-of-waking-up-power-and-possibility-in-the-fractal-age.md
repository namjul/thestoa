Everyone thinks they know what it means to be “woke” - whether they’re proudly declaring it, or angrily attacking it.

But writer, political entrepreneur and psychosocial therapist Indra Adnan has written a comprehensive and necessary account of “waking up” - to the realities of climate crisis, social breakdown, and personal agency – which implicates us all. In the internet era, no-one escapes the global revolution of learning, connecting and mobilising and its entangled consequences.

This reality demands a political response. But our current politics - led by divisive parties and their exhausted ideologies - are clearly broken and dysfunctional. Only 2% of the UK electorate think it’s worth the time or money to join a political party.

How do we put the full spectrum of a consciously awakening humanity at the heart of society, economy and politics? As social bonds fray and the planet burns, a politics of "waking up" is more urgently required than ever.

Informed by decades of public advocacy, transformative work with both local and global communities, as well as her lifelong commitment to self-development, The Politics of Waking Up lays out Adnan’s practical, beautiful and urgent ways to redesign politics for an era of people power.

Drawing on the last five years of political entrepreneurship as co-initiator of The Alternative UK, Adnan shares a compelling vision of a “fractal” politics with an emphasis on new patterns of behaviour and viable prototypes of social progress that can be copied and replicated everywhere.

The Politics of Waking Up presents a coherent, radical and profoundly feminine alternative to our current socio-political turbulence. One that is there for the taking.
