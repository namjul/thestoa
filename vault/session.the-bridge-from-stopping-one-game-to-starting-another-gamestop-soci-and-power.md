Evan takes us on a tour of the utterly insane events in the world of finance this week, as the battle between /r/WallStreetBets and the short-sellers over the future of GameStop (NYSE:GME) comes to a head, and together, we will attempt to make some sense of the implications for the future of financial markets, self-organizing collective intelligences, and the control system sometimes called the Blue Church.
