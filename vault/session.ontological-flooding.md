Paranthropology Jack Hunter visits The Stoa to discuss ontological flooding.

What is ontological flooding? From Jack ...

"The example that I use to explain ontological flooding a lot of the time is with spirit mediumship, where you have all of these competing explanations, which think that they’ve sorted it all out. Like I said before, social protest theories say that spirit mediumship is all about social protest. Then you’ve got biological, medical theories that say that spirit mediumship is just a biological aberration, as some kind of an illness or a disease. There are psychodynamic theories, all sorts of different theories, but at the end of the day, none of them is a completely satisfying explanation in themselves.

Actually, when you start to piece them together, we see that we’re dealing with something that is way more complex than any of those individual explanatory frameworks has been able to accommodate. So, ontological flooding is really saying...we need to take into account all of these various perspectives at the same time, to get the best or the nearest to reality perspective that we can get.”
