Mental Models w/ Peter Wang

This is a part of The Stoa's "Sensemaker in Residence" series. 

September 4th
September 11th
September 18th
September 25th

According to the blog Farnam Street:

“Mental models are how we understand the world. Not only do they shape what we think and how we understand but they shape the connections and opportunities that we see. Mental models are how we simplify complexity, why we consider some things more relevant than others, and how we reason.”

Peter Wang, entreprenur, former physicist, and student of the human condition, returns to The Stoa to as a "Sensemaker in Residence” for the month of September. Peter will discuss the mental models he personally uses to navigate life and all of its complexities. Models of selfhood, relationships, communications, and systems will be discussed.
