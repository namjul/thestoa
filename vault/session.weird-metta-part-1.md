Metta or loving-kindness practice is a sane default for meditation practice. It helps you love yourself and others more fully. Although metta is often taught in formulaic and repetitive (read: boring) ways, metta is most effective and enjoyable when you make it your own, exploring and playing with the kinds of images and phrases that generate the most joy, happiness, and love in your body-mind complex. In this three-part series, Tasshin will introduce you to loving kindness practice and help you to discover your own style of metta practice that resonates with you - your own form of "weird metta." This series will culminate in the third and final session, a metta-focused dance party, so you can embody and enjoy your newfound, weird and wonderful loving-kindness skills with others.
