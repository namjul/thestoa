How can we as humans survive and thrive through a perilous phase shift from a dying civilization to, potentially, an Age of Freedom and Clarity? In four consecutive Monday sessions in February, the hosts, Gregg Henriques and Greg Thomas, explore this liminal inquiry with deep thinkers who will engage in dialogos on themes from physics, biology, psychology, and culture to transcendent values, holistic communication, and a shared “wisdom commons” that exists prior to and beyond the state and the market.
