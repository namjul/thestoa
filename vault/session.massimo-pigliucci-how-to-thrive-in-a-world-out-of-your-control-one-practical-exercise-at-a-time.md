Stoicism is a philosophy of life, which means that it comes as a combination of interrelated theory and practice. This talk will explore a few examples of how to live like a Stoic in the pursuit of human excellence.

***

Toronto is the home to the largest Stoic community in the world. On September 8, 2019, Stoicism Toronto hosted Stoicon-X Toronto, a conference on Stoic practice. The Modern Stoic movement has found itself and is now in the process of discovering and developing ways to practice both individually and collectively. Speakers included Massimo Pigliucci, Donald Robertson, Chuck Chakrapani, and John Vervaeke.
