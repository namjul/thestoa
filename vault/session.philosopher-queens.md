Rachel Haywire and Raven Connolly discuss the rising of the Philosopher Queens! This is an introduction to a new series where Rachel and Raven talk with some of the baddest bitches on the internet. 

***

"We are the rising of the divine feminine in its chthonic form. We are Philosopher Queens. We blast open the doors of perception and explore the deepest areas of our minds and spirits. We revive the power of chaos in her original essence as our new order beings to take shape. We are Philosopher Queens. We are the origin of every story.

The zeitgeist is shifting, and we are here for it, doing the work. The Craft shall defeat Mean Girls. Veronica shall beat out the Heathers. What if Ursula were hot? Self-care-as-industry is on its way out, and the raw energy of Kali is coming back to play. Running with the wolves, confident and powerful, we seek a restoration of our own divinity."
