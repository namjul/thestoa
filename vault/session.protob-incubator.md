Jim talks ProtoBs - the movement within GameB from Theory to Action. ProtoBs are on-the-ground communities of people living GameB lives. He'll also discuss the ProtoB Incubator has been set up to catalyze and accelerate the creation of ProtoBs while developing design frameworks for re-use and adaptation.

"When a coherent group of people is attempting to live a GameB life that can be thought of as “whole” if not yet “complete”. My vision of the Journey has many ProtoBs coming into existence each with a different formula of GameBishness. I would expect ProtoBs to fission, merge, and some of them to fail. Maybe over time one or a small number prove themselves most efficacious at playing GameB and other ProtoBs will start to converge around them. Or maybe not, perhaps GameB will remain very diverse."
