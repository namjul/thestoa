I got an email from Bonnitta Roy that read: "Let's do something spontaneous on the 10th -- a psychotechnological thing." This gave birth to The Psychotechnology Playground. We have no idea what is going to occur here, but Bonnitta is going to work her magic with cutting edge conversational technology. This will be an interactive session. 60 mins
