Another special session for the Beyond Self-Discipline Zero (BSDv0) cohort.

This is the best model of the self my self has ever seen. B delivered a masterclass lecture on how the self. The Beyond Self-Discipline crew will now figure out this model can inform our DIY ecology of practice design. 

- Peter Limberg
