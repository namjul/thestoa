"In a postmodern world of information fragmentation, hyper-polarization, and social atomization consensus seems impossible, which is exactly why it has to be built. The research shows that skepticism of consensus building is misplaced; that it works in situations of high uncertainty and low trust, to build collective sensemaking and solidarity. The guided process begins by embracing the fear and chaos surrounding a given problem, a clear call to action, going through many steps and conceptual layers, and ends with wiser informed coordinated action and connectedness. Contrary to groupthink, consensus actually immunizes against herd mentality and promotes the integration of diverse views. From the group practices and building blocks that the Stoa stewards, to the exogenous critiques that problematize and strengthen the discourse, we are finally primed to build and experiment with a true collective intelligence for a common paradigm shift. Join us for a journey into block-removal, conceptual change, and conflict resolution towards consensus and coordination." - Brent Cooper
