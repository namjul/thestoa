Stealing the Culture with Dialogos returns. 

Four past guests of The Stoa return as well: Jack Donovan (“The Way of Men”), Ole Bjerg ("The Meaning of Being a Man”), Cadell Last (“Sex, Masculinity, God: The Trialogues”), and Nina Power (The upcoming: “What Do Men Want?”). 

These four engage in dialogos prompted by the question: What is the best way to be a man today?
