In this event, we’ll explore some of the most useful principles and practices for transforming our relationships with technology. We’ll also reflect on how we can apply these insights in our daily lives to support our connection with the things that matter most, harnessing the good of the digital world while mitigating the bad.

Being alive now means being surrounded by digital tools and inundated with constant tugs for our attention. It was hard enough to flourish in the pre-internet age; now we must do so within what Cal Newport calls a “lopsided arms race”. Each time we interact with an app or platform, we face off against billions of dollars and millions of hours poured into developing products that will maximize a single, dubious metric: our time spent online. This means that if we find ourselves struggling with binges, checking inboxes compulsively, or getting lost in endless scrolls, we deserve some real compassion and understanding -- we’re battling incredibly powerful forces. Our challenge, if we want to live well in the digital wilderness, is to give ourselves this charity while maintaining our sense of agency, power, and choice around how we relate to our digital tools. I invite you to join me in searching for this beautiful synthesis (and enjoying some all-too-accurate memes)!
