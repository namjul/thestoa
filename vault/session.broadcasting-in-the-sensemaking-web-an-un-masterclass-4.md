December 30th, 2020

A series to share all the skills of broadcasting for alternative media.

David Fuller has been an award-winning video journalist and filmmaker for two decades, with BBC & Channel 4 in the UK: http://davidfuller.tv/

In 2018 he founded Rebel Wisdom, covering philosophy, culture and transformation, which now has over 200,000 subscribers.

In this series we will explore everything from technology to storytelling, covering narrative structure, aesthetics, filming, editing, graphics, interviewing, production and framing.

This is an open un-masterclass. We encourage those who are aspiring or experienced podcasters and broadcasters in the "sensemaking web" (or adjacent spaces) to come and share their own best practice.
