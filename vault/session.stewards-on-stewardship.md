A dialogue amongst the Stewards on Stewardship: Steward of the Stoa and Steward of Collective Transitions (https://www.collectivetransitions.com)
Questions will be explored ... 

- What does it mean actually to steward a "field" or "organism"?
- What does Stewardship require?
- What does it mean to us in our respective roles and also as a role that these times call for as we transition from one paradigm to the next.
- What are we stepping out of and what are we stepping into when we are called and invited to take on a role as a steward?
