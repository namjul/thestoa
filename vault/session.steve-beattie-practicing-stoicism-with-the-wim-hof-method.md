Steve teaches breath work to individuals and groups as a way to boost physical performance, find their mental edge, and achieve a deep state of meditation - a state referred to as Transient Hypofrontality. In this talk, Steve introduces this concept which is followed-up by a group breathing exercise.

Toronto is the home to the largest Stoic community in the world. On September 8, 2019, Stoicism Toronto hosted Stoicon-X Toronto, a conference on Stoic practice. The Modern Stoic movement has found itself and is now in the process of discovering and developing ways to practice both individually and collectively. Speakers included Massimo Pigliucci, Donald Robertson, Chuck Chakrapani, and John Vervaeke.
