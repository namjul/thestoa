What is the Liminal Space Agency? Who do we think we are, and what have we been up to?

Who is Jean Robertson? What are her credentials? How does it come about that she’s marking her 79th birthday live on this Stoa session today? What’s the story?

Who are you to us and us to you, that you would enter into some kind of conversational space with us? What work might we have to do together?

Jean: I’m someone who remembers saying to a friend some time in the 1990’s ( my late 50’s, remember) “I want the rest of my life to be a series of passionate conversations”. And that wish has led to my finding myself on my 79th living and working with a group of people age range 20’s to 50’s in a constant stream of conversation.

I’ve never liked the idea of being an ‘elder’ yet I do resonate withliving into the question of what is it to become good ancestors for the future of humaning on this planet.

Liminal Space Agency’ is a learnng community with a shared focus on our taking 100% co-response-ability for the human conversation, and finding out what that means. It acts as a research and development vehicle/meta-monastery for stewarding what we’ve been calling the ‘sacred human conversation’.

Teresa: “And I’m thinking that it’s your life’s work that has led to the maps that we’ve been using to be able to steward this and take co-response-ability in the way that we are”.

Jean: it seems like we had better get on with it, if I am 79 and we sense that we’re just moving into a fertile phase.

Our current directions of learning:
Doing differences differently; living life and our lives as process; everyone’s subjective experience matters; making everything talk-about-able same-sidedly.
