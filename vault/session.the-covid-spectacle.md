Davood Gozli will facilitate a discussion on the emerging COVID Spectacle. Questions that will be considered: What does it mean to treat something as a spectacle? Are we so trained to identify, pay attention to, and to frame events as, spectacles that we would inappropriately identify and treat an event as a spectacle? What does this mean for our encounter with events of personal significance, including tragedy?  60 mins.
