Brooke McNamara is a poet, dance-theater artist, teacher, and Zen dharma holder. She is visiting The Stoa to do a workshop around her new course: Summoning the Unseen

"In these bewildering times, both our inner and outer worlds are undergoing rapid change and unraveling. So much is unknown and yet to be seen. We may fear becoming overwhelmed or disconnected from the emotional, relational, and spiritual resources we need most right now.

And so ~

Let us gather together around a fire of great wisdom and love, and become still.

Let us become concentrated and warmed by the flames, pulled into a heartfelt, coherent listening, born of a visceral longing for the Numinous.

When we listen like this, we effortlessly lean toward what we innately belong to, what wants to guide and inspire us from just beyond the veils of consensus reality."
