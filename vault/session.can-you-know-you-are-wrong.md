Philosopher Agnes Callard visits The Stoa.

Do you know what it’s like to be wrong? I’m not asking whether you know what it’s like to have been wrong. If you think back to something you were wrong about in the past, what you are effectively doing is thinking about how right you are now: at least you’re not making that mistake anymore! It would be very different to recognize that you are, currently, thinking about something incorrectly. That would be real humility. But is it possible?
