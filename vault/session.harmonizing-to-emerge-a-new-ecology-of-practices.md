The Monastic Academy is running an experiment at its Canadian branch, WILLOW. For three months, eight residents are exploring an ecology of practices that generate a profound experience of individual and collective harmony. John Vervaeke, Daniel Thorson, and Seishin Todorović will discuss the program, and residents will be available for questions. Presented in connection with the Emerge Conference in Berlin. Also be sure to check in again on Sunday, October 17th for Harmonizing to Emerge: A Stoic at the Monastic Academy.
