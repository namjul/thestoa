In the session, Ole Bjerg is joining us for a conversation about money. We shall be talking about money as a system that ties all of us into the economy. But we are also going to look at money as an existential issue that shape our intimate relations with ourselves and other people. The time is as ripe as ever for this kind of conversation as the old system of money is crumbling and new forms of money are emerging to take over. The session also functions as a teaser for a course on money consisting of the three sessions: Me and Money; Where does money come from? and The future of money is already here.
