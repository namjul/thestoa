Chapel Perilous is a place where we train ourselves to dissolve the barriers between us and them, to think flexibly about our own identities and to get comfortable with uncertainty. We use playful exercises drawn from socratic dialogue, meditative practice and occultism. And hopefully emerge as radical agnostics capable of bearing witness to our own personal crises of meaning.
