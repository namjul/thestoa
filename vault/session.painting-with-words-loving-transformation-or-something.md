The sensemaking poet himself, Tim Adalin from VoiceCraft Collective, visits The Stoa for a sensemaking art experiment.

An experimental piece of philosophy that will seek to share images, movements, and conceptions of response to existential questions of life and time. Questions of love, death, and transformation. Questions of teleology, process, and event. Questions of meaning, nihilism, sacredness and the absurd.

What is it to paint with words?â€”And how can we step into novelty together, grounded in devotion to something worthwhile?
