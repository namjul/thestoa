What does the philosophy of Stoicism and the idiom of jazz have in common? Born in different historical and socio-economic contexts, they both gesture towards a way of life that requires an embrace of uncertainty. They ask us to view the obstacle as the way and not something that is in the way. On June 29th Greg Thomas, Peter Limberg, and the Stoa family will improvise their way towards making a connection. 

Bio: Greg Thomas is a writer, intellectual, and entrepreneur rooted in the blues and jazz as cultural frames and technologies of insight and wisdom. He is CEO of the Jazz Leadership Project, which powers the Tuneintoleadership.com blog. He has recently entered the culture wars as a memetic mediator, bringing to bear the blues idiom as well as heuristic tools such and Integral metatheory and Metamodernism.
