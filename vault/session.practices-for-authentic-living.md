How present are you as you communicate and listen to others? Are you aware and present, somewhat distracted, or pretty much on automatic? What fosters relational presence? And what interferes with it? Susan will offer her insights gleaned from her research and from her 55 year career as a relationship coach and teamwork consultant. She will guide an exploration into the human tendencies that interfere with authentic relating, and she will offer her favorite practices for bringing your conversations into the here and nowâ€”toward the aim of more aliveness, clarity, connection, trust, and shared learning.
