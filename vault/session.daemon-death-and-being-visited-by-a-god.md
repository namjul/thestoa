Peter chats with Stephen Jenkinson about the daemon, death, truthfulness, the dis-ease of COVID, and being visited by a God. 

"Stephen is a teacher, author, storyteller, spiritual activist, and founder of Orphan Wisdom, a teaching house for skills of deep living and making human culture that is mandatory in endangered, endangering times. He makes books, tends farm and mends broken handles and fences, succumbs to interviews, teaches and performs internationally.

Orphan Wisdom is the home of Stephen Jenkinson’s writing and teaching work. Orphan Wisdom is a teaching house for the skills of deep living and making human culture. It is a redemptive project that comes from where we come from. It is rooted in knowing history, being claimed by ancestry, working for a time we won’t see.​"
