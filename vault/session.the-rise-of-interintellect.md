Anna Gát visits The Stoa to discuss the rise of the Interintellect, as both a concept and a community that hosts regular salons.

"Every day we come together from all over the world to talk about books and relationships, technology and art, philosophy and science – all the feelings and thoughts we experience as humans – without judgement or certificates.

Our Salons are facilitated by Interintellect Hosts as patient, open, nonpolitical exchanges accessible to any level of expertise. Think the best conversations you had in college. Imagine your favourite newsletter coming alive! Prepare to make some amazing friends…."
