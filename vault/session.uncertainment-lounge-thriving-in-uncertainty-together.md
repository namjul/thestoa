Uncertainment is a practice of sensing across divergent views in real-time in order to deepen our participation with the unknowable and the uncontrollable. This session will set a minimal frame for the emergence of collective practices of negative capability unique to the moment. Befriending uncertainty in a safe yet brave context, we will grapple together in the wobbly ambiguity of not knowing, witness, make sense, listen and dare - and in so doing extend our capability to care, choose and respond.
