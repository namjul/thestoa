"A spectre is haunting the left—the spectre. . . of Jordan Peterson.

With his deft performances in interviews and his constant courtship of controversy, Peterson has, since 2016, emerged as the public intellectual par excellence of the political right.

Yet for all the furor he’s engendered amongst progressives, few have been willing to confront his body of work, which melds together neuropsychology and Jung in rigorous fashion. In this text, four young authors of disparate positions among the political Left unite to show that Peterson’s attempt to address the contradictions characteristic of late-capitalist society ultimately conceals a more deeply-reactionary animus. And this animus can only be overcome if, rather than dismissing Peterson outright, we endeavour to understand why he came to exist in the first place. From their disparate positions within (and often enough, against) the political left, our 4 authors are here each united to provide their own unique critiques of Dr. Jordan Peterson." https://drjordanbpeterson.ca/the-book/
