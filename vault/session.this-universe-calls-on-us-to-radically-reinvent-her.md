Howard Bloom visits The Stoa to discuss his Grand Unified Theory of Everything in the Universe Including Sex, Violence, and the Human Soul. What do rock and roll, the early history of Islam, and the evolution of the cosmos from the big bang to what's going on in your brain as you read this sentence have in common? Bloom explains that his field is mass behavior, from the mass behavior of quarks to the mass behavior of humans.

Each of his seven books is a radically different exploration of that mass behavior, from the birth of the first atoms (The God Problem), to the evolution of multicellular beings (Global Brain), to the biological roots of evil (The Lucifer Principle), to economics (The Genius of the Beast) and to the search for the gods inside of us in popular music (Einstein, Michael Jackson & Me).
