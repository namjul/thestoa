Nina Power joins Rachel Haywire and Raven Connolly to discuss the philosophical, collective and personal dimensions of sex, the body, and adult development. We will ask Nina about biology and the possibility of transcending its restrictions, alienation and dysphoria as experienced by men vs women, the differences between male and female secret societies, and much more. Nina is a former academic, cultural commentator, and the author of One Dimensional Woman.
