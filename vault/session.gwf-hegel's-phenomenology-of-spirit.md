In this talk, philosopher Cadell Last will give an overview to the Foreword of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit (originally written by J.N. Findlay in 1979).  Throughout the lecture you will learn why the Phenomenology of Spirit can be understood as a major philosophical event in the history of human thought, the general totality or aim that Hegel wanted to achieve in this book, and the major themes and ideas that are approached throughout the text itself.  This talk will also be a teaser for a general course on the Phenomenology of Spirit, where you will be offered the chance to analyze the book as a whole, 8 sessions chapter by chapter, over the course of 16 weeks.
