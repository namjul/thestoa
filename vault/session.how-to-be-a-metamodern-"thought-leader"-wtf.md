Learn how to cultivate and perpetrate a mythos that allows you smuggle philosophical sensibilities into the heart of Enterprise Land—without losing yourself in the process. Further: learn how to resist the echo-chamber of narcissism, and the myriad sirens that might lead you astray.

Dr Jason Fox is a bestselling author, leadership advisor and wizard-philosopher of ace repute. He shows forward-thinking leaders around the world how to pioneer new and meaningful progress—beyond the default. https://www.drjasonfox.com/
