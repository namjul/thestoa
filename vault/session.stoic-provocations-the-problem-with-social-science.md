Stoic Provocations is a new series that affords us the opportunity to practice our Stoicism. A speaker visits us, shares some edgy thoughts that put us at the edge of our thinking. We possibly get triggered, stop the recording and get into a collective dialogue, with a little twist ...

Jane Gatsby joins The Stoa to talk about the problem with social science and how it inhibits our capacity to have productive, meaningful conversations.
