Luke Kemp, research associate at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, visits the Stoa to discuss the “Stomp Reflex” and a possible antidote towards it.

“Emergency powers tend to only go one way: top-down. During an emergency, the knee-jerk reaction is always to stomp-down, to reinforce those atop hierarchies in the state and significantly curtail the freedoms, voice and agency of citizens, often in a draconian fashion. I call this the "Stomp Reflex”.”
