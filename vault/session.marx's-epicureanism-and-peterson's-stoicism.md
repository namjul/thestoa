Is Jordan Peterson a crypto-Stoic? Is his rhetorical foil of choice—Marx—a crypto-Epicurean? While any such comparison will be approximate, what Peterson and specifically the pre-1845 Marx share in common with these schools is their tendency to index subjectivity to differential conceptions of nature that in turn furnish us with directives for praxis. Yet should we survey the latter, post-1845 Marx, what we find is a problematization of this notion—one that leads him to posit the import of subjectivity as lying in the way its transitory emergence permits the resolution of particular historical impasses (as with the proletariat as “universal class”). This idea—of the Darwinian-Hegelian historical succession of universal classes/subjects—can, when applied to the current culture war, offer us insight into how we should go forward.
