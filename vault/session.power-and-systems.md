â€œI've invited Barry to join us in a conversation about power and systems.  Barry's book' Seeing systems' has had a big influence on the thinking of many in our learning community, and with over 50 years of experience in the human systems space, we are excited to learn from the perspectives Barry holds.  We invite folks from this community to bring their curiosity for the kind of beautifully spontaneous Q&A that we hold at the Stoa - a conversation of relevance to the world we find ourselves in today" - Naryan Wong
