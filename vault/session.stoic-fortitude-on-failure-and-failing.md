Frequent failures and failings are a common experience with any intentional way of living, and Stoicism is no exception.  In this interactive session, we'll look at modes of getting things wrong, what advice classic Stoics offer when we fail, and how the virtue of fortitude helps us deal with our failings and failures. Presentation followed by Q&A and discussion.
