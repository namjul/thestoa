Justin Weinberg visits The Stoa to discuss disagreement. While disagreement is often treated as a problem, Weinberg thinks there are some overlooked upsides to it. Heâ€™ll talk about the value of disagreement, obstacles to disagreeing well, and how we might better get along with those with whom we disagree, touching on questions in ethics, political philosophy, and metaphilosophy.

Justin is a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina. He also runs the popular philosophy news and discussion site, Daily Nous: http://dailynous.com
