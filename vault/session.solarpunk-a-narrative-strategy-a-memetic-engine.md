Solarpunk is an emerging movement in speculative fiction, art, fashion and activism that seeks to answer and embody the question “what does a sustainable civilization look like, and how can we get there?”

The future is as much about today as it is tomorrow. This talk is about the de-furing impulses of mass culture, cultural fracking, atemporality, juxtaposition, futexture, and more. How can we use narrative strategies to imagine new speculative presents in order to re-future the future?

Jay Sprigett is a consultant strategist, currently specialising in the distributed web, metaverse, and world running. He works with individuals and organisations to create cohesive worlds.

In 2019 he was selected as one of WeAreEurope’s 64 Faces of Europe and is a Fellow of Royal Society of Arts. He co-founded the decentralised creative exchange guild.is and is a member of the Global Regeneration CoLab. His Solarpunk short story ‘In The Storm, A Fire’ was long listed for the BSFA 2020 Short Fiction Award.
