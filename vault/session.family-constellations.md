Bertold Ulsamer (www.ulsamer.com) visits The Stoa to discuss Family Constellations.

What is family constellations? 

"The German therapist Bert Hellinger developed with the family constellations a new type of short, intensive therapy. This systematic approach is a further development of multi-generation family therapy which stands alone in its own right. Hellinger discovered a host of principles and orders which occur in the network of relationships and bonds through many generations. These orders and principles prove themselves through the practical work. One could describe a family constellation as a living genogram (family tree), set up by a particular family member, which includes elements of family sculptures and psychodramas. Family constellations are ingenious in their form and theoretical approach and have surprising procedures and effects."
