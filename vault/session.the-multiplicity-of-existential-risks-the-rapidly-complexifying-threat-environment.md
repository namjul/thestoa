This session is a part of the "Let Us Maybe Make the Meta-Crisis Our Superordinate Goal Symposium"

Phil Torres visits The Stoa. In this session, Phil will discuss the rapidly complexifying x-risk landscape.

About Phil: "I am an author, scholar, and freelance writer whose work focuses on existential risks to humanity and civilization. I used to write for the Future of Life Institute and was once a research assistant for Ray Kurzweil and Affiliate Scholar at the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies. I spent some time at Harvard University and earned a master's degree in Neuroscience from Brandeis University, although my background is in the Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Science. I am currently a PhD candidate at Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, in Germany, writing about the ethics of stratospheric geoengineering. However, my forthcoming book Human Extinction: A History of Thinking About the End of the World is a work of intellectual history."
