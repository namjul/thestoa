Those notes met the realities of covid 19, the lockdowns and upheavals, and turned into something of a plague document. The book’s entries are dated, and chronologically rendered, and read as dispatches from the front lines of a strange occupation undeclared. What does a life’s work mean in a time of undoing? A Generation’s Worth sets out to learn liveable answers. Dying and death, love and matrimony, money and soul, aging and elderhood, drawn through the eye of a pestilential needle: this is the spirit work, and that is the crisis.”\n\nPurchase: https://orphanwisdom.com/a-generation...\nTrailer: https://youtu.be/nzwJM16RrIk\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Those notes met the realities of covid 19, the lockdowns and upheavals, and turned into something of a plague document.

From Jack ...\n\n\"The example that I use to explain ontological flooding a lot of the time is with spirit mediumship, where you have all of these competing explanations, which think that they’ve sorted it all out. Like I said before, social protest theories say that spirit mediumship is all about social protest. Then you’ve got biological, medical theories that say that spirit mediumship is just a biological aberration, as some kind of an illness or a disease. There are psychodynamic theories, all sorts of different theories, but at the end of the day, none of them is a completely satisfying explanation in themselves.\n\nActually, when you start to piece them together, we see that we’re dealing with something that is way more complex than any of those individual explanatory frameworks has been able to accommodate. So, ontological flooding is really saying...we need to take into account all of these various perspectives at the same time, to get the best or the nearest to reality perspective that we can get.”\n\nWebsite: https://jack-hunter.webstarts.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Chris is well known for his book A Small Farm Future. In it, he argues that our best hope for an optimistic future will be centered around local economies, self-provisioning, and agricultural diversity. In this session, we hope to interrogate Chris on the explicit pathways he might see for us to achieve a small farm future. Drawing on Chris’ encyclopedic historical knowledge of past agricultural societies, we’d like to ask him to talk through some historical precedents for our time period.\n\nOne example might be the Middle Ages, which often gets a bad rap, but recently Chris tweeted “I’d suggest almost the opposite - dark ages are often when ruling elites stop ruling & forget how to keep writing about their own brilliance for posterity. Then ordinary people can come out a play for a bit. Dark age for some, but not for others…” We hope to debate the question of a sustainable diet and best strategies for achieving agricultural diversity in a world where environmental policy makers increasingly call for a global diet.  Finally, in advance of our next session with Dr. Vandana Shiva, we will ask Chris to envision what international cooperation around a small farm future might look like, and how we can help.\n\nMore from Chris: https://smallfarmfuture.org.uk/\nMore sessions from Doomer Optimism: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoZ5e3aD_LuRA8KAhmYqselHOWt9nT0Xj\nNext session of Doomer Optimism: https://zoom.us/meeting/register/tJwlfuCrqDIuHN06VPlT6PLmiylHbBrPtRPl\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

There is a climate emergency that requires urgent action, but the precise nature, cost, location and responsibility of that action is moot. There is a broader crisis of civilisational purpose that appears to necessitate political and economic transformation, and there are deeper socio-emotional, educational, epistemic and spiritual features of our predicament that manifest as many flavours of meta-crisis: the lack of a meaningful global ‘We’, widespread learning needs, self-subverting political logics and disenchanted worldviews. These different features of our world are obscured by their entanglement with each other. It is difficult to orient ourselves towards meaningful action that is commensurate with our understanding because we are generally unclear about the relationship between different kinds of challenge and what they mean for us. That’s what this essay is about. The world is in a pickle, and, daunting though it is, we need to learn how to taste it. Tasting the pickle well requires, in the spirit of Vivekananda, finding joy and releasing energy through the right kinds of discrimination.”\n\nSource: https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport stealing the culture: patreon.com/the_stoa\nReceive coaching with resonance: https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches"},{"fname":"content/posts/resolving-the-meta-crisis-with-emergent-movements-and-post-consumerist-praxis.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"Resolving the Meta-Crisis With Emergent Movements and Post-Consumerist Praxis","date":"2021-09-01T22:00:00.000Z","slug":"resolving-the-meta-crisis-with-emergent-movements-and-post-consumerist-praxis","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/jacob-lund-fisker.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/meta.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/crisis.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/emergent-movements.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/post-consumerist-praxis.md"}]},"content":"September 2nd, 2021\n\nEven twenty years into the early 21st century we remain unable to agree on how to solve the multiple big and complex problems facing the world, still thinking reality is just a matter of opinion until it hits too close and personal. Why is that? And lacking agreement what can any one person do to drive a change of course beyond riding along to the sound of inevitability? In this presentation I describe the construct of the problem, a way to design a post-consumerist philosophy specifically with emergent movements in mind, and the method of nurturing that emergence into a self-sustaining movement that prepares the ground for change.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

This can be tricky to see but immensely relieving once recognized. It dissolves a pattern that often causes burnout in folk who are trying to do as much good as they can — while also revealing why so many efforts to do good create the opposite effect. In this three-part series, ex-savior-aholic Michael Smith will offer a framework for both understanding and directly experiencing the underlying truths here. The aim is to offer relief, pop some beliefs that serve egos instead of compassion, and embody kindness in a way that matters. The first session will be an introduction and overview with some discussion and hopefully a little experimental practice, and the following two sessions will focus on practice and embodiment with content TBD based on what happens in each session.

In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows. The localists talk about homesteading and small farms, the bioregionalists talk about healing ecological trauma and living within the limits of the earth, the decentralization movement talks about currency protocols and smart contracts, and the metamodernists talk about stage theory while drinking lattes from their urban condos. In this session we will discuss what these movements have in common, and how they can put aside their differences, synthesize their perspectives while not always liking each other, and unite to save the planet while solving our precious meaning crisis too. \n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format.

She will describe the 5 steps of trigger work and then guide participants in some exercises from the book—exercises that teach you how to catch and calm trigger reactions so you can get back to being present and resourceful. Doing these exercises will help you heal your fear of emotional discomfort and allow you to handle situations you used to avoid.\n\n Here is an excerpt from the book: “Your trigger reactions can be the doorway to understanding and embodying a much bigger life process that I like to call whole-making. As I see it, life itself is about whole-making —integrating the various parts of a system into increasingly interrelated wholes. Our trigger reactions help us see aspects of ourselves that we may be unaware of. As we explore these reactions, we discover parts of ourselves that have been denied, abandoned, or repressed. This is the realm of the human unconscious that psychologists call our shadow. As we enter through this portal, we encounter forgotten hurts and disappointments, unmet childhood needs, protective personality habits that we adopted to keep us safe, beliefs that help us make sense of things we don’t understand, and ideas about ourselves and others that feed the insecure ego’s need to be knowledgeable, good, or right. Discovering and learning to accept these lost parts helps us actualize more of our unique human potential. As we embrace and welcome these parts, we become more whole.”\n\nwww.susancampbell.com\nwww.amazon.com/Triggered-Tranquil-Self-Compassion-Transform-Relationship/dp/1608687406\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The latter two have long since failed and passed out of the pages of history, and the first no longer operates as an ideology, but rather as something taken for granted. The world today finds itself on the brink of a post-political reality — one in which the values of liberalism are so deeply embedded that the average person is not aware that there is an ideology at work around him.\n\nAs a result, liberalism is threatening to monopolise political discourse and drown the world in a universal sameness, destroying everything that makes the various cultures and peoples unique. According to Alexander Dugin, what is needed to break through this morass is a fourth ideology — one that will sift through the debris of the first three to look for elements that might be useful, but that remains innovative and unique in itself.\"\n\nDugin's website here: http://www.4pt.su/en\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The difference from today's politics will be at least as radical as the difference between monarchy and democracy as we have known them. But will sensocracy be a central computer A.I. police-state dictatorship, as currently planned in Communist China, or can the rest of the world respond with a properly developed concept of a sensocracy that remains free, open and creative?

Thanks to group chats and a wave of private online social platforms, squads are reemerging today as a potent cultural force that rejects a strictly individualist market philosophy. Squads play a key role not only in internet community dynamics but in emerging economic networks. Hawala, chit funds, chamas and other forms of P2P savings or credit associations are notable precursors to the kinds of financial relationships we anticipate decentralized cryptocurrency protocols will soon enable. These proto-squads are an example of Coaseian logic at play—that is, strong internal coordination decreases transaction costs, enabling greater productive capacities and financial opportunities as a group.\n\nThe informal nature of these peer-to-peer institutions, often composed of neighbors and friends, reveals the central role that trust plays in squad logic. Whether housemates or friends sharing a Discord group, squads allow social currency and financial capital to inter-convert, creating opportunities and group resiliency that would have been impossible to achieve alone.\"\n\nMore info: https://otherinter.net/squad-wealth\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In the age of social media, personal expression has become the most valuable form of currency, yet we still use the term ‘counterculture’ to describe alternatives to the hegemonic forces of yesteryear, as if dressing middle-class, white, and preppy still aligned with the rules of power today.\n\nIn an era more profoundly organized by Big Tech than our own elected governments, the new culture to be countered isn’t singular or top-down. It’s rhizomatic, nonbinary, and includes all who live within the Google/Apple/Facebook/ Amazon digital ecosystem (aka GAFA stack). With digital platforms transforming legacy countercultural activity into profitable, high-engagement content, being countercultural no longer means being counter-hegemonic. What logic could possibly be upended by punks, goths, gabbers, or neo-pagans when the internet, a massively lucrative space of capitalization, profits off the personal expression and political conflict of its users?\"\n\nMore from Caroline: https://carolinebusta.github.io\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We will review the most cynically effective protocols to work through and settle the grieving process. From the perspective of Tibetan Bon and Buddhist meditation practices, the practitioner prepares for dying by practicing consciousness-transferences. While dying there are three after-death states—the state of the actual dying practice, the state of the sound and light show of the dharmahatu, and the state determining rebirth. The advanced practitioner learns to carry meditation practice into these three after-death states, so as to use the dying process as an opportunity to complete Buddhahood. The most advanced practitioner uses the dying process to dissolve the residual substantiality of the physical body upon dying, so as to achieve great consciousness-transference or rainbow body.

Instead, regeneration is about activating the capability and will to shift unhealthy ingrained patterns so that we can step into our innate potential as stewards of life. Regeneration involves relationality and the ability to cultivate it towards higher orders of complexity. We are co-evolutionary participants with this world and regeneration is about bringing that into awareness and practice again - caring for and taking responsibility for our commons. Soul Shivers is a multimedia dialogue series dedicated to weaving disparate voices of women from around the world in service of collective regeneration. Twice a year, we gather four women around four themes and collectively support the dialogues with multimedia expressions seen in art, poetry, letters, and more. The themes we will explore are (1) ancestry (2) trauma (3) connection to place and (4) peace. \" - Freya and Luea\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Each effector pattern has three parts: (1) a breathing pattern, (2) facial expression, and (3) postural attitude. All three parts work together to create one effector pattern, or biological code, that directly stimulates nerves, cells and organs. The resulting pattern works like a key that opens the door for one particular basic emotion to express throughout the entire body.\n\nThe discovery of these patterns helped to create a physical method for evoking and regulating emotion.

In the internet era, no-one escapes the global revolution of learning, connecting and mobilising and its entangled consequences.\n\nThis reality demands a political response. But our current politics - led by divisive parties and their exhausted ideologies - are clearly broken and dysfunctional. Only 2% of the UK electorate think it’s worth the time or money to join a political party.\n\nHow do we put the full spectrum of a consciously awakening humanity at the heart of society, economy and politics? As social bonds fray and the planet burns, a politics of \"waking up\" is more urgently required than ever.\n\nInformed by decades of public advocacy, transformative work with both local and global communities, as well as her lifelong commitment to self-development, The Politics of Waking Up lays out Adnan’s practical, beautiful and urgent ways to redesign politics for an era of people power.\n\nDrawing on the last five years of political entrepreneurship as co-initiator of The Alternative UK, Adnan shares a compelling vision of a “fractal” politics with an emphasis on new patterns of behaviour and viable prototypes of social progress that can be copied and replicated everywhere.\n\nThe Politics of Waking Up presents a coherent, radical and profoundly feminine alternative to our current socio-political turbulence. One that is there for the taking.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Technocapitalism cephalises - it becomes a sentient and autonomous entity. It gains a will of its own, continually recycling human desire for its own survival and replication. And it is only accelerating. Ontological design is a way of facing up to this dire state of affairs. It is the idea that we can acknowledge our circumstances and make the best of them - perhaps going so far as designing our desires, our beliefs and our ontologies, the very vectors technocapitalism colonises us through.\n\nIn this session, Daniel Fraga and Owen Cox from Technosocial Podcast are joined by an illustrious panel composed by transhumanist philosopher queen Rachel Haywire, rabble-rousing rogue sensemaker Andrew Sweeny from Parallax Magazine and the internet's foremost memeticist, Chris Gabriel from Meme Analysis.\n\nWe will explore questions such as: what do spiritual and magical traditions have to teach us, who live in this weirdest of ages? What kind of subcultures can emerge in this panorama? How do we understand and engage with the ghosts, poltergeists and egregores of the world-wide web? In crafts like carpentry, it is said that there is a will, a wisdom inherent in the material itself - that the possibility for the finished product already exists, latent, in the wood. What is then latent in the prima materia of human attention? What is Art, in this context? And what kind of darkness must we face in order to stare it dead in the eye?\n\nJoin us for a trip to the underworld - if you can handle it.\n\n***\n\nRead more about ontological design here: https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/the-manifesto-of-ontological-design-7fdb19169107\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport stealing the culture: patreon.com/the_stoa\nReceive coaching with resonance: https://www.thestoa.ca/coaches"},{"fname":"content/posts/the-elusive-i.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"The Elusive I","date":"2021-06-23T22:00:00.000Z","slug":"the-elusive-i","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/john-vervaeke.md"},{"author":"content/authors/gregg-henriques.md"},{"author":"content/authors/christopher-mastropietro.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"}]},"content":"June 24th, 2021\n\nJohn, Gregg, and Chris return to The Stoa to conclude their dialogos series with a Q&A.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Often, when a newcomer joins an institution like the Willow Monastic Academy, this presents a significant change to their regular way of life, and is an unexpected challenge to how they show up in the training.\n\nWe may expect it to be difficult to sit on the cushion and meditate for two hours a day, but it turns out the difficult thing is actually to be on time for activities, to wash our dishes well, and to exercise every day. The ways in which we habitually fall out of the structure are mirrors to our ingrained habit-patterns, and can be seeds for significant self-exploration.\n\nIn this talk, Sei will talk about why a shared structure can be an incredibly beneficial tool for human maturation, how this shows up at Willow, and how we may be able to bring this into our lives even without becoming full-time monastics\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The aim is to offer relief, pop some beliefs that serve egos instead of compassion, and embody kindness in a way that matters.

After leading global design teams at Facebook and Autodesk, she now coaches leaders and teams to achieve their creative potential.\n\nLisa is a professor of Design Leadership in Parsons School of Design Strategies at the New School. She is prototyping Uncertainty Lab, a group process for cultivating states of negative capability, and Design Being, a pattern language for designers and cultural influencers.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We are guided to introspect on our thinking and behaviour, to make connections between our past and our present circumstances, and to learn how to let go of the past and make positive changes.\n\nHowever, because the effects of trauma and conditioning are actually held physically - in the body - they may also be addressed in that environment.\n\nWorking with the body in this manner also removes the biases that can come from living in an environment where there is much subtle and non-subtle influencing about how we &quot;should be.&quot; Understanding that we are blocked, we can simply work to remove the blocks, knowing that whatever remains will be a more pure version of our authentic self.\n\nIn Bioenergetics, we put our body into specific postures and then endeavour to maintain the posture, whilst breathing deeply through the mouth and remaining intimately in touch with the felt sense of the body. At some point, holding patterns from the muscle system begin to release.\n\nThe aim of Bioenergetics is to leave you feeling more grounded and more open, better able to hold safe boundaries and simultaneously more okay with being vulnerable.\n\nSession Timetable:\n-Introduction to Bioenergetics and the session - 15 mins\n-Guided Bioenergetics session - 30 mins\n-Q&A - 30 mins\n\nPlease wear loose clothing and take responsibility to not be intoxicated.\n\nSome of the exercises will require a small amount of sound, perhaps grunting or similar.

The research shows that skepticism of consensus building is misplaced; that it works in situations of high uncertainty and low trust, to build collective sensemaking and solidarity. The guided process begins by embracing the fear and chaos surrounding a given problem, a clear call to action, going through many steps and conceptual layers, and ends with wiser informed coordinated action and connectedness. Contrary to groupthink, consensus actually immunizes against herd mentality and promotes the integration of diverse views. From the group practices and building blocks that the Stoa stewards, to the exogenous critiques that problematize and strengthen the discourse, we are finally primed to build and experiment with a true collective intelligence for a common paradigm shift.

This includes putting ourselves above others by standing for equality more resolutely. We'll explore this increasingly untenable contradiction woven into Western moral life. Being less egotistical is one way of addressing this tension, but I'll explore a more taboo, route. We can recognise that ideals of equality offer an amazingly effective moral ‘rule of thumb’, but have, unhealthily, become enshrined as the truth, taboo to even question. They have also become a very unsatisfactory replacement for compassion and love, which in more ‘spiritual’ times were the center of moral life, with consequences that may be truly disastrous when considered alongside issues such as climate chaos.\"\n\nhttps://lifeitself.us\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In a society driftless in the geography of nowhere, waking up to the unfulfilled promises of techno-capital globalism, terrified by climate change and ecological collapse, a new potential is emerging, a regenerative movement weaving together the pastoral nostalgia of traditional life, the ecological and indigenous consciousness of the Gaia brigade, the collective intelligence of decentralized systems, and the cultural theory of political metamodernism. But it remains potential, natural allies but awkward bedfellows.\n\nIn this session Ashley and Jason will tell the story of the birth of Doomer Optimism on Twitter, and ask the participants of the session to co-create the definition and examples of what Doomer Optimism might come to represent. The goal of this session is to set the stage, define terms and expectations, and begin the formation of a big tent community.\n\nThis session will be the first part of a Doomer Optimist Series hosted by Ashley and Jason. The series will start by interviewing some public intellectuals, asking them to bring their perspective to bear on Doomer Optimism. The series will then hold several panels of doomer optimists, making some space to ask questions, solve problems, and make plans.

In this series, Adam Robbert will bring TSV to The Stoa and explore the nature of philosophical practice inside and outside of the academy, the peril and promise of doing philosophy in the wild, and the relation between askēsis and the deliverances of philosophy. On this view, it is through exercise—both conceptual and nonconceptual, theoretical and practical—that philosophical illumination is achieved.\n\nSession 1: Attention Is an Art Form: The Roots of TSV, featuring Adam Robbert and David Collins\n\nhttps://thesideview.co\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

This can be tricky to see but immensely relieving once recognized. It dissolves a pattern that often causes burnout in folk who are trying to do as much good as they can — while also revealing why so many efforts to do good create the opposite effect. In this three-part series, ex-savior-aholic Michael Smith will offer a framework for both understanding and directly experiencing the underlying truths here. The aim is to offer relief, pop some beliefs that serve egos instead of compassion, and embody kindness in a way that matters. The first session will be an introduction and overview with some discussion and hopefully a little experimental practice, and the following two sessions will focus on practice and embodiment with content TBD based on what happens in each session.

We are human primates. We are social in our very bones. Isolation is punishment. Silence is dull.\n\nHere is another definition: meditation is the bringing of attention to experience, and training in meditation is training in attention. By this definition, neither isolation nor silence are required; we can train together, and that is good, because together is what we were born for.\nSocial meditation brings the benefits of traditional silent meditation while simultaneously cultivating intimacy and strengthening bonds between humans. Social meditation is engaging in a way that only social activities can be. And social meditation provides a built-in feedback loop; when two or more people are taking turns reporting their experience in real time, there is little time for mind wandering. Meditators stay on task, thereby increasing the efficiency of training.\"\n\nMore: https://www.socialmeditation.training/\n\nRSVP for more sessions: www.thestoa.ca\nJoin The Stoa mailing list: https://thestoa.substack.com\nIntro song: Kali Yuga Blues by Bardo Pond\n\nThe Stoa is based on the gift economy.

The core idea is that one of these two subagents constructs a model of the \"world.\" The agent that constructs the world model is the conscious agent whose \"experiences\" represent the attention mechanism implemented by that agent. This model proposes a materialistic explanation of the distinction between Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness and proposes a solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The model also explains normal human consciousness, flow state, and enlightened \"self-less\" states of consciousness.\n\nIn Part 2 (of 2), on January 16th, Frank \"Explains Spirituality\" using a materialistic three-agent model of the brain; this model builds on the two-agent model of Part 1 presented on Jan 9th. If you didn't see that talk, please watch it on The Stoa YouTube channel or watch the 26-minute video on www.SpiritualityExplained.com. The core idea is that modern humans have developed a potent \"Thinker\" agent (the third agent of the three-agent model), which has enabled modern human civilization's attainments. Unfortunately, the Thinker often causes suffering for modern humans, and spirituality was developed to ameliorate that suffering.\n\nThe development of the more powerful Thinker agent in modern humans can clarify the distinctions between animal consciousness, normal human consciousness, flow state, and the various enlightened states of consciousness. This model also shows that common spiritual practices can result in decreased suffering. Some forms of spiritual practices allow the attainment of \"Enlightenment,\" which can eliminate the suffering caused by the Thinker. \n\nwww.SpiritualityExplained.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

For us, regeneration is not just a set of alternative solutions - nor is it just about nature. Instead, regeneration is about activating the capability and will to shift unhealthy ingrained patterns so that we can step into our innate potential as stewards of life. Regeneration involves relationality and the ability to cultivate it towards higher orders of complexity. We are co-evolutionary participants with this world and regeneration is about bringing that into awareness and practice again - caring for and taking responsibility for our commons. Soul Shivers is a multimedia dialogue series dedicated to weaving disparate voices of women from around the world in service of collective regeneration. Twice a year, we gather four women around four themes and collectively support the dialogues with multimedia expressions seen in art, poetry, letters, and more. The themes we will explore are (1) ancestry (2) trauma (3) connection to place and (4) peace. \" - Freya and Luea\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Designed as a field handbook, it aims at helping us observe, navigate, and orientate into the increasingly artificial fabric of the world. Plastiglomerates, surveillance robot dogs, fordite, artificial grass, antenna trees, Sars-Covid-2, decapitated mountains, drone-fighting eagles, standardised bananas… each of these specimens are symptomatic of the rapidly transforming “post-natural” era we live in. Often without us even noticing them, these creatures exponentially spread and co-exist with us.\n\nA Bestiary of the Anthropocene seeks to capture this precise moment when the biosphere and technosphere merge and mesh into one new hybrid body. What happens when technologies and their unintended consequences become so ubiquitous that it is difficult to define what is “natural” or not? What does it mean to live in a hybrid environment made of organic and synthetic matter?

Yet should we survey the latter, post-1845 Marx, what we find is a problematization of this notion—one that leads him to posit the import of subjectivity as lying in the way its transitory emergence permits the resolution of particular historical impasses (as with the proletariat as “universal class”).

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know? Using the IM, and developing a novel solution in community governance (Ephemeral Group Process), Forrest holds unique insight into the designs and thinking necessary to steward life and earth into the next levels of right relationship with all of life and nature. In true Forrest style, this Sensemaker in Residence will be in open Q&A format.

A term documented by historian Richard Hofstadter in the 1960s, anti-intellectualism has returned with a vengeance in the 21st century. It refers to a general or specific distrust of experts, academics, and ideas, and can be found in laymen and intellectuals alike. From Trumpism to the Intellectual Dark Web, Rebel Wisdom to the Stoa itself, anti-intellectualism is a latent curse against our better collective judgement and community building. It is reason used as a weapon against reason. Understanding it as a long term trend as well as a present homegrown crisis is key to undoing its damage. The responsibility of intellectuals to \"speak truth and expose lies\" (Chomsky) is inherently risky and alienating, but avoiding or denying it is to be complicit in systemic evil.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

The core idea is that one of these two subagents constructs a model of the \"world.\" The agent that constructs the world model is the conscious agent whose \"experiences\" represent the attention mechanism implemented by that agent. This model proposes a materialistic explanation of the distinction between Access Consciousness and Phenomenal Consciousness and proposes a solution to the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The model also explains normal human consciousness, flow state, and enlightened \"self-less\" states of consciousness.\n\nIn Part 2 (of 2), on January 16th, Frank \"Explains Spirituality\" using a materialistic three-agent model of the brain; this model builds on the two-agent model of Part 1 presented on Jan 9th. If you didn't see that talk, please watch it on The Stoa YouTube channel or watch the 26-minute video on www.SpiritualityExplained.com. The core idea is that modern humans have developed a potent \"Thinker\" agent (the third agent of the three-agent model), which has enabled modern human civilization's attainments. Unfortunately, the Thinker often causes suffering for modern humans, and spirituality was developed to ameliorate that suffering.\n\nThe development of the more powerful Thinker agent in modern humans can clarify the distinctions between animal consciousness, normal human consciousness, flow state, and the various enlightened states of consciousness. This model also shows that common spiritual practices can result in decreased suffering. Some forms of spiritual practices allow the attainment of \"Enlightenment,\" which can eliminate the suffering caused by the Thinker. \n\nwww.SpiritualityExplained.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

We ate up ghost stories and creepy villains.\n\nAs an adult, when someone spoils how the movie ends we get pissed off. We want the excitement of finding out how the mystery turns out. Why then, in this moment do we grasp for certainty?\n\nWill it save us from the fear inside?\n\nWe are told many lies about fear. I fell in every pothole created by these lies, and here’s what I know... The cure for the pain is in the pain. (Thanks, Rumi.)\n\nI’ve bumped my head on every rung of the ladder looking outside myself for certainty to escape that pain. I tried to outsource my sovereignty eight ways from Sunday – to healers, intuitives and exec coaches, and charismatic preachers. No, that didn’t work. I handed over my power to synchronicity to tell me what to do. No. I even found a way to over-rotate following my own damn ideas about how to be a “good” human.\n\nNo, no, and no.\n\nHow do you make the tough decisions in a time where nothing seems constant anymore, even the inside of your own head and heart?\n\nThis calibration is done via your body. It’s the needle of the compass on your emotional and energetic GPS. My card deck, Becoming Dragon, gives you a playful way through the pain. Inside every dark emotion (envy, shame, fear, etc) there is a gift. This deck takes you on a treasure hunt instead of staying stuck and suffering.\n\nAs Voodoo Donut says, “the magic is in the hole.”\n\nMore: https://www.crisbeasley.com\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

Forrest founded Magic-Flight after spending a large portion of his career in software architecture roles for the FBI, DARPA, and the Library of Congress. Notably, his development of the Immanent Metaphysics (IM) has enabled both broad and deep insights into the nature of the core questions of epistemology and ontology: what is, and how do we know?

From Plato onwards, love both permits access to knowledge and presents a distraction to it. This week will examine the multiple types of Greek love - philia, eros, pragma, storge, philautia, ludus, agape, xenia - and suggest that our age has become unduly dominated by one particular idea of love - a combination of eros and possessiveness, love as a commodity. Against this, the love of the philosophers, past and present - love of the city, love that opens people up to the cosmos, will be presented as a critique of our narrow image. \n\nMore from Nina: https://ninapower.net\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

With identitarian illiberalisms rising on both its left and right flanks, can the flailing neoliberal world order regain its footing and fend off collapse? Even if liberal capitalism could reclaim the political legitimacy it once had and was able to wrestle power away from fascists and communists, it would still have to contend with the ecological disruption the modern industrial mode of production has caused to our own for too long forgotten ground: the Earth, or Gaia as I prefer to call her. We are now in the Anthropocene, meaning human history has become merged with geology. We've always been made of mud and thus part of the planet. But we are beginning to understand the misplaced concreteness of our old mechanical theories of Nature, and to recognize the consequences of the unsustainable practices these theories have informed. It has become clear that unless we want to become fossils, a fundamental transformation of our mode of production and social imaginary will be necessary. Liberalism, fascism, and communism are the three main attractors of modern politics. None of them has proven capable of dealing with the Gaian reality we now find ourselves inhabiting. In my talk, I'll draw on what has been called the \"immanental philosophies\" of the American pragmatist tradition (including Emerson, Peirce, James, Dewey, and Whitehead) to lay out several underlying system errors in the modern worldview and try to gesture toward the possibility of a non-modern, ecological alternative.\n\nWhy are the YouTube comments disabled?

In this session Ashley will discuss her philosophical predisposition toward hands-on and embodied learning, and how that led her to build a field school for experiential learning in Uruguay. As the pandemic played out, Ashley turned to twitter and found a community of other practitioners, people trying their hands at a land-based existence, and she fell into the Homestead corner of twitter. She also noticed a whole other group of aspirational homesteaders, people worried about the world we are in, and trying to build a lifestyle that's both more resilient and more connected with others. Fundamentally a connector, Ashley will talk about how she sees the opportunity to make a Homestead Incubator class as pairing those experienced homesteaders with the aspirational ones. She will discuss her several overlapping goals for the class: 1. To give an overview of perspectives, heuristics, and lessons from experienced practitioners, 2. To encourage people to make friendships with both mentors and other students, 3. Build a repository of hands-on, practical advice, and 4. Start to build out an alumni network of both instructors/students that blossoms into a million different classes, workshops, regional support groups, and events.

While Socrates was executed for being a gadfly and trying to teach, today we see his legacy fetishized in practice, entry level philosophy, and conversational games. Meanwhile, the frame of philosophy of \"Western civilization\" and reason itself are crumbling, revealing a more complex social reality.

In this text, four young authors of disparate positions among the political Left unite to show that Peterson’s attempt to address the contradictions characteristic of late-capitalist society ultimately conceals a more deeply-reactionary animus. And this animus can only be overcome if, rather than dismissing Peterson outright, we endeavour to understand why he came to exist in the first place. From their disparate positions within (and often enough, against) the political left, our 4 authors are here each united to provide their own unique critiques of Dr. Jordan Peterson.\" https://drjordanbpeterson.ca/the-book/\n\nRSVP for more sessions: www.thestoa.ca\nJoin The Stoa mailing list: https://thestoa.substack.com\nIntro song: Kali Yuga Blues by Bardo Pond\n\nThe Stoa is based on the gift economy.

While the story can - and perhaps should - be viewed in many ways, it is widely considered to be about our failure to contend with ecological collapse due to climate change, despite knowing about the problem and roughly what needs to be done about it, for many decades. \n\nThose who dislike the film tend to find it shrill, exaggerated, unfunny, or think it is based on a bad analogy, or that it fails to offer a way out. But those who like the film tend to find it a uncannily close to life as we know it, a great metaphor that offers a refreshingly entertaining take on the nature of our predicament, and a timely challenge to reflect on the power dynamics, human waywardness and societal ruderlessness that arguably make mere 'calls to action' absurd. \n\nPerspectiva and The Stoa would like to give the film closer attention and to discuss it with our communities, starting with the suggestion that the movie is prismatic of what has been called our 'meta-crisis' -  a term with many framinings and definitions, but all concerned with the underlying dynamics within, behind, between and beyond surface phenomena. Indeed, it may be that the film is impressive precisely because it sets the agenda in style and substance for how to grasp the meta-crisis.\n\nTo make the most of this event, we request that everyone attending should watch Don't Look Up. We also strongly encourage everyone attending to either read Tasting the Pickle: Ten flavours of meta-crisis and the appetite for a new civilisation or watch Jonathan Rowson's talk at The Stoa about it.\n\nhttps://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/\n\nDonate to Perspectiva: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=NS3TQYD4N6SZL\n\nMore events: thestoa.ca\nRegular updates: thestoa.substack.com\nSupport The Stoa: patreon.com/the_stoa"},{"fname":"content/posts/afterlife-is-there-consciousness-after-death.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"Afterlife","excerpt":" Is There Consciousness After Death?","date":"2022-01-26T23:00:00.000Z","slug":"afterlife-is-there-consciousness-after-death","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/daniel-pinchbeck.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/afterlife.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/consciousness.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/death.md"}]},"content":"January 27, 2022\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck visits The Stoa to discuss his new book, Afterlife: Is There Consciousness After Death?\n\n\"In Afterlife, Is There Consciousness After Death?, New York Times bestselling author Daniel Pinchbeck (Breaking Open the Head, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl) builds the philosophical foundation for a new understanding and acceptance of our existence as souls and spirits within a larger continuum of consciousness, connecting contemporary scientific knowledge with ancient esoteric and shamanic wisdom traditions. Changing our relationship to the afterlife will also transform our relationship to this world. As the worldview of monistic or analytic idealism displaces the obsolete model of reductive materialism, the values of our civilization will also change profoundly.

The central idea is that our biosphere is facing an ecological emergency and that we have serious failings in other areas of public life that are preventing us from adequately addressing this emergency. Most notably, our political, socio-cultural, economic, and educational systems are all showing very serious failures, and thus we can consider each of these to be a distinct crisis in its own right. These crises are exacerbated by a breakdown in public sensemaking and by distortions within the information ecology. At the core is the so-called meaning crisis, which leads many people to confusion and alienation and an inability to find sufficient intelligibility and purpose within their lives.”\n\nhttps://medium.com/@brandon_29259/comparing-approaches-to-addressing-the-meta-crisis-9393e6ee17d7\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com"},{"fname":"content/posts/the-cathedral.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"The Cathedral","date":"2022-04-17T22:00:00.000Z","slug":"the-cathedral","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/curtis-yarvin.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/cathedral.md"}]},"content":"April 18th, 2022\n\n\"The cathedral” is just a short way to say “journalism plus academia”—in other words, the intellectual institutions at the center of modern society, just as the Church was the intellectual institution at the center of medieval society.\"\n\nMore: https://graymirror.substack.com/p/a-brief-explanation-of-the-cathedral\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com"},{"fname":"content/posts/beyond-self-discipline-teaser.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"Beyond Self-Discipline Teaser","date":"2022-03-31T22:00:00.000Z","slug":"beyond-self-discipline-teaser","authors":[],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/self.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/discipline-teaser.md"}]},"content":"Starts April 1st, 2022\n\nhttps://maven.com/thewisdomgym/beyond-self-discipline\n\nVideo created by Reid Gower: www.youtube.com/c/ReidGower"},{"fname":"content/posts/swarms-egregores-and-autocults.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"Swarms, Egregores, and Autocults","date":"2022-03-22T23:00:00.000Z","slug":"swarms-egregores-and-autocults","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/john-robb.md"},{"author":"content/authors/bj-campbell.md"},{"author":"content/authors/patrick-ryan.md"},{"author":"content/authors/jordan-hall.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/swarms.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/egregores.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/autocults.md"}]},"content":"March 23rd, 2022\n\nJohn Robb, BJ Campbell, Patrick Ryan, and Jordan Hall engage in a dialogos to make sense of a new emerging entity in the noosphere.\n\nRecommended viewing/reading ...\n\nSwarms: https://youtu.be/kIFfwXuRwG0\nEgregores: https://hwfo.substack.com/p/memespace-egregores-and-nuclear-war\nAutocults: https://youtu.be/630qu6u7JN4\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com"},{"fname":"content/posts/truth-trust-and-culture-war.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"Truth, Trust, and Culture War","date":"2022-04-24T22:00:00.000Z","slug":"truth-trust-and-culture-war","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/zubin-damania.md"},{"author":"content/authors/christopher-kavanagh.md"},{"author":"content/authors/ben-burgis.md"},{"author":"content/authors/david-fuller.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/truth.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/trust.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/culture-war.md"}]},"content":"April 25th, 2022\n\nZubin Damania (ZDoggMD), Chris Kavanagh, Ben Burgis, and David Fuller visit The Stoa to discuss how truth, trust, and culture warring have shown up during the last two years of this pandemic.\n\nZubin: https://www.youtube.com/c/ZDoggMD\nChris: https://decoding-the-gurus.captivate.fm/\nBen: https://www.youtube.com/c/BenBurgisGTAA\nDavid: https://www.youtube.com/c/RebelWisdom\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com"},{"fname":"content/posts/global-guerrillas-report-swarms-vs-nukes.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"Global Guerrillas Report","excerpt":" Swarms vs Nukes","date":"2022-03-03T23:00:00.000Z","slug":"global-guerrillas-report-swarms-vs-nukes","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/john-robb.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/global-guerrillas.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/report.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/swarms-vs.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/nukes.md"}]},"content":"March 4th, 2022\n\nJohn Robb visits The Stoa to discuss his latest Global Guerrillas Report on swarms vs nukes.\n\n\"The global, open-source movement, composed of nations, corporations, and individuals, has assembled in just a few days to oppose Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Thus, all these properties relate to people who produce ersatz wisdom: a corrupt epistemics that creates the appearance of useful knowledge, but has none of the substance.”\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/19PKXFn3qrzWr6nx622g9cEzyNBow0svQs_dN4fP3hjY/edit\n\nthestoa.ca\npatreon.com/the_stoa\nthestoa.substack.com"},{"fname":"content/posts/the-aesthetic-of-the-meta-aesthetic-the-meaning-nexus-between-memeplexes.mdx","frontmatter":{"title":"The Aesthetic of the Meta-Aesthetic","excerpt":" the Meaning Nexus Between Memeplexes","date":"2022-01-24T23:00:00.000Z","slug":"the-aesthetic-of-the-meta-aesthetic-the-meaning-nexus-between-memeplexes","authors":[{"author":"content/authors/andres-gomez-emilsson.md"}],"tags":[{"tag":"content/tags/session.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/meta.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/meaning.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/nexus.md"},{"tag":"content/tags/memeplexes.md"}]},"content":"January 25th, 2022\n\n‘In the spirit of fostering a collaborative relationship between the memeplexes that currently occupy the minds of the post-political intelligentsia, Andrés will share a conceptual framework he believes is useful for sense-making independently of one’s subcultural affiliation. Namely, he will share a theory of aesthetics. Aesthetics go much deeper than merely the preference one may have for clusters and correlations of sensorial patterns. Aesthetics, in fact, cut to the very root of our concept of identity. Inspired by Rob Burbea’s Soulmaking, Andrés will discuss how aesthetics can be broken down into: (1) Eros - the set of images that energize one’s thirst for life, (2) Psyche - the network of relationships between Eros imagery, and (3) Logos - the overarching ontology upon which Psyche and Eros are based. Andrés will discuss how these components emerge from specific philosophical background assumptions, are then adopted as social aesthetics, and ultimately risk becoming merely tribal markers. In so far as people are caught up in the dissonance between aesthetics without understanding the Logos that breaths life into them, they will continue to fight in unproductive ways. Ultimately, a careful map of the valence that an aesthetic associates to each symbol will allow us to create a *music theory* of aesthetics and liberate people from the burden of pointless memetic wars. Meaning that, we can predict in advance what kind of discussions are likely to break down due to different valences on key load-bearing symbols, and re-route them through a different path that nonetheless achieves the desired information processing. An understanding of how aesthetics bias our valuations would itself be an aesthetic, of course: the aesthetic of the meta-aesthetic. This talk will argue that such a meta-aesthetic could become the nexus that allows us to “get the best of each world”. The end-goal: to make aesthetic pluralism game-theoretically stable.

Hypersubjects are typically, but not exclusively white, male, northern, well-nourished, and modern in all senses of the term. They wield reason and technology, whether cynically or sincerely, as instruments for getting things done. They command and control; they seek transcendence; they get very high on their own supply of dominion. Do you want to know what is irritating hypersubjects today? The fact that hyperobjects are whispering in their ears, whispering that this being and time that they have fashioned in their image and for their own convenience is dying.

He presented a Global Problematique, where he defined 49 Continuous Critical Problems as rapidly merging into a single megacrisis. However, the Club of Rome chose to fund the Limits to Growth project and not Özbekhan’s pitch, since the Forrester and Meadows’ team had cool tech of system dynamics modeling. As Özbekhan foresaw, the Problematique continues, and we live within the complex entailments of increasing population, growth economy, technological efficiency, etc. But unlike 1970, we now have methods for engaging with social systems, and reflecting on our own traps of “problem solving” traps that we know only perpetuate these superwicked problems.
